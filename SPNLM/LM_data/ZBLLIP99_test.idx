No , it was n't Black Monday . 
But while the New York Stock Exchange did n't fall apart Friday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged <unk> points -- most of it in the final hour -- it barely managed * to stay this side of chaos . 
Some `` circuit <unk> '' installed * after the October 1987 crash failed their first test , traders say 0 *T* , * unable * to cool the selling panic in both stocks and futures . 
The 49 stock specialist firms on the Big Board floor -- the buyers and sellers of last resort who *T* were criticized * after the 1987 crash -- once again could n't handle the selling pressure . 
Big investment banks refused * to step up to the plate * to support the <unk> floor traders by * buying big blocks of stock , traders say 0 *T* . 
Heavy selling of Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index futures in Chicago <unk> beat stocks downward . 
Seven Big Board stocks -- UAL , AMR , BankAmerica , Walt Disney , Capital <unk> , Philip Morris and Pacific Telesis Group -- stopped * trading and never resumed . 
The <unk> has already begun . 
`` The equity market was <unk> . 
Once again -LCB- the specialists -RCB- were not able * to handle the imbalances on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange , '' said *T* Christopher <unk> , senior vice president at <unk> Securities <unk> . 
<unk> 0 <unk> James <unk> , chairman of specialists Henderson Brothers Inc. : `` It <unk> is easy * to say 0 the specialist is n't doing his job . 
When the dollar is in a <unk> *T* , even central banks <unk> n't stop it . 
<unk> are calling for a degree of liquidity that *T* is not there in the market . '' 
Many money managers and some traders had already left their offices early Friday afternoon on a warm autumn day -- because the stock market was so quiet . 
Then in a <unk> plunge , the Dow Jones industrials in barely an hour <unk> about a third of their gains this year , * <unk> up a <unk> , or 6.9 % , loss on the day in <unk> trading volume . 
<unk> trading accelerated to <unk> million shares , a record for the Big Board . 
At the end of the day , <unk> million shares were traded * . 
The Dow Jones industrials closed at <unk> . 
The Dow 's decline was second in point terms only to the <unk> Black Monday crash that *T* occurred Oct. 19 , 1987 . 
In percentage terms , however , the Dow 's <unk> was the <unk> ever and the <unk> since the market fell <unk> , or 8 % , a week after Black Monday . 
The Dow fell <unk> % on Black Monday . 
Shares of UAL , the parent of United Airlines , were extremely active all day Friday , * <unk> to news and rumors about the proposed $ <unk> billion *U* buy-out of the airline by an <unk> group . 
Wall Street 's <unk> speculators , or `` risk arbitragers , '' had placed unusually large bets that a takeover would succeed and UAL stock would rise . 
At <unk> p.m. EDT , came the <unk> news : The Big Board was <unk> trading in UAL , `` pending news . '' 
On the exchange floor , `` as soon as UAL stopped * trading , we <unk> for a panic , '' said 0 *T* one top floor trader . 
Several traders could be seen * <unk> their heads when the news <unk> *T* . 
For weeks , the market had been nervous about takeovers , after Campeau Corp. 's cash crunch spurred concern about the prospects for future highly leveraged takeovers . 
And 10 minutes after the UAL trading halt came news that the UAL group could n't get financing for its bid . 
At this point , the Dow was down about 35 points . 
The market <unk> . 
<unk> could n't dump their UAL stock -- but they rid themselves of nearly every `` rumor '' stock 0 they had *T* . 
For example , their selling caused trading <unk> <unk> to be declared * in USAir Group , which *T* closed down 3 <unk> to 41 <unk> , Delta Air Lines , which *T* fell 7 <unk> to 69 <unk> , and Philips Industries , which *T* sank 3 to 21 <unk> . 
These stocks eventually <unk> . 
But as panic spread , speculators began * to sell blue-chip stocks such as Philip Morris and International Business Machines * to offset their losses . 
When trading <unk> was halted * in Philip Morris *T* , the stock was trading at 41 , down 3 <unk> , while IBM closed 5 <unk> lower at 102 . 
<unk> <unk> because of waves of automatic `` <unk> '' orders , which *T* are triggered * by computer when prices fall to certain levels *T* . 
Most of the stock selling pressure came from Wall Street professionals , including <unk> program traders . 
Traders said 0 most of their major institutional investors , on the other hand , sat tight . 
Now , at <unk> , one of the market 's post-crash `` reforms '' took hold as the S&P 500 futures contract had plunged 12 points , equivalent to around a <unk> drop in the Dow industrials . 
Under an agreement signed * by the Big Board and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange , trading was temporarily halted * in Chicago . 
After the trading halt in the S&P 500 pit in Chicago , waves of selling continued * to hit stocks themselves on the Big Board , and specialists continued * to <unk> prices down . 
As a result , the link between the futures and stock markets <unk> apart . 
Without the <unk> of stock-index futures -- the barometer of where traders think 0 the overall stock market is headed * *T* -- many traders were afraid * to trust stock prices quoted * on the Big Board . 
The futures halt was even <unk> * by Big Board floor traders . 
`` It <unk> things up , '' said *T* one major specialist . 
This confusion effectively halted one form of program trading , stock index arbitrage , that *T* closely links the futures and stock markets , and has been blamed *T* by some for the market 's big swings . 
-LRB- In a stock-index arbitrage sell program , traders buy or sell big <unk> of stocks and offset the trade in futures * to lock in a price difference . -RRB- 
`` When the airline information came through *T* , it <unk> every model 0 we had *T* for the marketplace , '' said *T* a managing director at one of the largest <unk> firms . 
`` We did n't even get a chance * to do the programs 0 we wanted * to do *T* . '' 
But stocks kept * falling . 
The Dow industrials were down 55 points at 3 p.m. before the <unk> halt . 
At <unk> p.m. , at the end of the `` cooling off '' period , the average was down <unk> points . 
Meanwhile , during the the S&P trading halt , S&P futures sell orders began * <unk> up , while stocks in New York kept * falling sharply . 
Big Board Chairman John J. <unk> said yesterday 0 the circuit <unk> `` worked well <unk> . 
I just think 0 it <unk> 's <unk> at this point * to get into a debate if index arbitrage would have helped or hurt things . '' 
Under another post-crash system , Big Board President Richard <unk> -LRB- Mr. <unk> was flying to <unk> as the market was falling -RRB- was talking on an `` <unk> hot line '' to the other exchanges , the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve Board . 
He <unk> out at a high-tech <unk> center on the floor of the Big Board , where he could watch <unk> on prices and pending stock orders *T* . 
At about <unk> p.m. EDT , S&P futures resumed * trading , and for a brief time the futures and stock markets started * to come back in line . 
<unk> stepped in to the futures pit . 
But the <unk> of S&P futures sell orders <unk> on the market , and the link with stocks began * to <unk> again . 
At about <unk> , the S&P market <unk> to still another limit , of 30 points down , and trading was locked * again . 
Futures traders say 0 the S&P was signaling that the Dow could fall as much as 200 points . 
During this time , small investors began * <unk> their brokers , * wondering whether another crash had begun . 
At Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. , which *T* is trying * to <unk> to small investors , some <unk> brokers thought 0 this would be the final <unk> . 
That 's when George L. Ball , chairman of the Prudential Insurance Co. of America unit , took to the internal <unk> system * to declare that the plunge was only `` mechanical *T* . '' 
`` I have a <unk> that this particular decline today is something <unk> more <unk> about less . ' 
It <unk> would be my <unk> * to advise clients * not to sell , to look for an opportunity * to buy , '' Mr. Ball told the brokers *T* . 
At Merrill Lynch & Co. , the nation 's biggest brokerage firm , a news release <unk> was prepared * <unk> * `` Merrill Lynch <unk> on Market <unk> . '' 
The release cautioned that `` there are significant differences between the current environment and that of October 1987 '' and that there are still `` attractive investment opportunities '' in the stock market . 
However , Jeffrey B. Lane , president of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. , said that Friday 's plunge is `` going * to set back '' relations with customers , `` because it <unk> the concern of volatility . 
And I think 0 a lot of people will <unk> on program trading . 
It 's going * to bring the debate right back to the <unk> . '' 
As the Dow average ground to its final <unk> loss Friday , the S&P pit stayed locked at its <unk> trading limit . 
Jeffrey <unk> of program trader <unk> Investment Group said 0 2,000 S&P contracts <unk> were for sale on the close , the equivalent of $ 330 million *U* in stock . 
But there were no buyers . 
While Friday 's debacle involved mainly professional traders rather than investors , it left the market vulnerable to continued selling this morning , traders said 0 *T* . 
<unk> futures contracts settled at much lower prices than indexes of the stock market itself . 
At those levels , stocks are set up * to be <unk> * by index arbitragers , who *T* lock in profits by * buying futures when futures prices fall *T* , and simultaneously sell off stocks . 
But nobody knows at what level the futures and stocks will open today *T* . 
The <unk> between the stock and futures markets Friday will undoubtedly cause renewed debate about whether Wall Street is properly prepared for another crash situation . 
The Big Board 's Mr. <unk> said , 0 `` Our <unk> performance was good . '' 
But the exchange will `` look at the performance of all specialists in all stocks . 
Obviously we 'll take a close look at any situation in which we think 0 the <unk> obligations were n't met * *T* , '' he said *T* .

But specialists complain privately that just as in the 1987 crash , the `` <unk> '' firms -- big investment banks that *T* support the market by * trading big blocks of stock -- stayed on the sidelines during Friday 's <unk> . 
Mr. <unk> said , 0 `` It <unk> will take another day or two '' * to analyze who *T* was buying and selling Friday .

George Morton

The agreements bring to a total of nine the number of planes 0 the travel company has sold *T* this year as part of a restructuring . 
The company said 0 a portion of the $ 32 million *U* realized * from the sales will be used * * to repay its bank debt and other obligations resulting from the currently suspended <unk> operations . 
Earlier the company announced 0 it would sell its aging fleet of Boeing Co. <unk> because of increasing maintenance costs . 
A consortium of private investors operating as <unk> Funding Co. said 0 it has made a $ <unk> million *U* cash bid for most of <unk> Hooker Corp. 's real-estate and <unk> holdings . 
The $ <unk> million *U* bid includes the assumption of an estimated $ 300 million *U* in secured liabilities on those properties , according to those making the bid . 
The group is led * by Jay <unk> , chief executive officer of <unk> Investment Corp. in <unk> , and A. <unk> Simpson , chief executive of the Atlanta-based Simpson Organization <unk> . 
Mr. <unk> 's company specializes in commercial real-estate investment and claims * to have $ 1 billion *U* in assets ; Mr. Simpson is a developer and a former senior executive of <unk> Hooker . 
`` The assets are good , but they require more money and management '' than * can be provided * in <unk> Hooker 's current situation , said 0 *T* Mr. Simpson in an interview . `` 
Hooker 's philosophy was * to build and sell . 
We want * to build and hold . ''

Its parent company , Hooker Corp. of Sydney , Australia , is currently being managed * by a <unk> provisional <unk> . 
Sanford <unk> , chief executive of <unk> Hooker , said yesterday in a statement that he has not yet seen the bid but that he would review it and bring it to the attention of the creditors committee . 
The $ <unk> million *U* bid is estimated * by Mr. Simpson as * representing 75 % of the value of all Hooker real-estate holdings in the U.S. . 
Not included * in the bid are *T* <unk> <unk> or B. <unk> & Co. , <unk> Hooker 's <unk> chains .

Other Hooker properties included * are a <unk> office tower in <unk> Atlanta , expected * to be completed * next February ; vacant land sites in Florida and Ohio ; <unk> Hooker International , the commercial real-estate brokerage company that *T* once did business as Merrill Lynch Commercial Real Estate , plus other shopping centers . 
The consortium was put * together by <unk> <unk> , the London-based investment banking company that *T* is a subsidiary of Security Pacific <unk> . 
`` We do n't anticipate any problems in * raising the funding for the bid , '' said Allan Campbell , the head of mergers and acquisitions at <unk> <unk> , in an interview .

Eventually Mr. Simpson and Mr. <unk> had a falling out over the direction of the company , and Mr. Simpson said 0 he resigned in 1988 . 
Since then , Hooker Corp. has sold its interest in the <unk> chain back to <unk> 's management and is currently attempting * to sell the B. <unk> & Co. chain . 
In addition , Robert <unk> , chief executive of the <unk> chain , is seeking funds 0 *T* to buy out the Hooker interest in his company .

As small investors <unk> their mutual funds with phone calls over the weekend , big fund managers said 0 they have a strong defense against any wave of withdrawals : cash . 
Unlike the weekend before Black Monday , the funds were n't <unk> * with heavy withdrawal requests . 
And many fund managers have built up cash levels and say 0 they will be buying stock this week . 
At Fidelity Investments , the nation 's largest fund company , telephone volume was up sharply , but it was still at just half the level of the weekend preceding Black Monday in 1987 . 
The Boston firm said 0 <unk> redemptions were running at less than one-third the level two years ago . 
As of yesterday afternoon , the redemptions represented less than 15 % of the total cash position of about $ 2 billion *U* of Fidelity 's stock funds . 
`` Two years ago there were massive redemption levels over the weekend and a lot of fear around , '' said *T* C. Bruce <unk> , who *T* runs Fidelity Investments ' $ 5 billion *U* <unk> Fund . 
`` This feels more like a <unk> deal . 
People are n't <unk> . '' 
The test may come today . 
Friday 's stock market sell-off came too late for many investors to act . 
Some shareholders have held off until today because any fund exchanges made * after Friday 's close would take place at today 's closing prices . 
Stock fund redemptions during the 1987 debacle did n't begin * to <unk> until after the market opened on Black Monday . 
But fund managers say 0 they 're ready . 
Many have raised cash levels , which *T* act as a <unk> against steep market declines . 
Mario Gabelli , for instance , holds cash positions well above 20 % in several of his funds . 
<unk> Fund 's John <unk> and Mutual Series ' Michael Price said 0 they had raised their cash levels to more than 20 % and 30 % *U* , respectively , this year . 
Even Peter Lynch , manager of Fidelity 's $ <unk> billion *U* <unk> Fund , the nation 's largest stock fund , built up cash to 7 % or $ 850 million *U* . 
One reason is that after two years of monthly net redemptions , the fund posted net <unk> of money from investors in August and September . 
`` I 've let the money build up , '' Mr. Lynch <unk> said *T* , who *T* added that he has had trouble * finding stocks 0 he likes *T* . 
Not all funds have raised cash levels , of course . 
As a group , stock funds held 10.2 % of assets <unk> in cash as of August , the latest figures available from the Investment Company Institute . 
That was modestly higher than the 8.8 % and 9.2 % *U* levels in August and September of 1987 . 
Also , persistent redemptions would force some fund managers to dump stocks * to raise cash . 
But a strong level of investor withdrawals is much more unlikely this time around , fund managers said 0 *T* . 
A major reason is that investors already have sharply <unk> back their purchases of stock funds since Black Monday . 
<unk> sales have rebounded in recent months , but monthly net purchases are still running at less than half 1987 levels . 
`` There 's not nearly as much <unk> , '' said *T* John <unk> , chairman of Vanguard Group Inc. , a big Valley <unk> , Pa. , fund company . 
Many fund managers argue that now 's the time 0 * to buy *T* . 
Vincent <unk> , manager of the $ 1.8 billion *U* Wellington Fund , added to his positions in Bristol-Myers Squibb , Woolworth and Dun & Bradstreet Friday . 
And today he 'll be looking * to buy drug stocks like Eli Lilly , Pfizer and American Home Products whose dividend yields *T* have been bolstered * by stock declines . 
Fidelity 's Mr. Lynch , for his part , snapped up Southern Co. shares Friday after the stock got <unk> * . 
If the market drops further today , he said 0 he 'll be buying blue chips such as Bristol-Myers and Kellogg . 
`` If they <unk> stocks like that , '' he said *T* , it presents an opportunity that *T* is `` the kind of thing 0 you dream about *T* . '' 
Major mutual-fund groups said 0 phone calls were arriving at twice the normal weekend pace yesterday . 
But most investors were seeking share prices and other information . 
Trading volume was only modestly higher than normal . 
Still , fund groups are n't taking any chances . 
They hope * to avoid the <unk> phone lines and other <unk> that *T* <unk> some fund investors in October 1987 . 
Fidelity on Saturday opened its 54 <unk> investor centers across the country . 
The centers normally are closed through the weekend . 
In addition , East Coast centers will open at <unk> EDT <unk> this morning , instead of the normal <unk> . 
T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. increased its staff of phone representatives 0 *T* to handle investor requests . 
The <unk> group noted that some investors moved money from stock funds to money-market funds . 
But most investors seemed * to be `` in an information <unk> rather than in a transaction <unk> , '' said 0 *T* Steven <unk> , a vice president . 
And Vanguard , among other groups , said 0 it was adding more phone representatives today * to help investors get through . 
In an unusual move , several funds moved * to calm investors with <unk> on their <unk> phone lines . 
`` We view -LCB- Friday 's -RCB- market decline as * offering us a buying opportunity as long-term investors , '' a recording at Gabelli & Co. funds said *T* over the weekend . 
The <unk> Group had a similar recording for investors . 
Several fund managers expect a rough market this morning before prices stabilize . 
Some early selling is likely * to stem from investors and portfolio managers who *T* want * to lock in this year 's fat profits . 
Stock funds have averaged a <unk> gain of 25 % through September , according to Lipper Analytical Services <unk> . 
<unk> <unk> , who *T* runs Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 's $ <unk> million *U* <unk> <unk> <unk> , predicts 0 the market will open down at least 50 points on technical factors and `` some panic selling . '' 
But she expects prices to rebound soon and is telling investors 0 she expects 0 the stock market <unk> n't decline more than 10 % to 15 % *U* from recent highs . 
`` This is not a major crash , '' she said *T* . 
Nevertheless , Ms. <unk> said 0 she was <unk> * with phone calls <unk> over the weekend from nervous shareholders . 
`` Half of them are really scared and want * to sell , '' she said , `` but I 'm trying * to talk them out of it . '' 
She added , 0 `` If they all were bullish , I 'd really be upset . '' 
The <unk> to Friday 's slide was <unk> different from that of the October 1987 crash , fund managers argue 0 *T* . 
Two years ago , unlike today , the dollar was weak , interest rates were rising and the market was very <unk> , they say 0 *T* . 
`` From the investors ' <unk> , institutions and individuals learned a painful lesson <unk> by * selling at the lows '' on Black Monday , said 0 *T* Stephen <unk> , manager of the $ <unk> million *U* T. Rowe Price Growth and Income Fund . 
This time , `` I do n't think 0 we 'll get a panic reaction . 
Newport Corp. said 0 it expects * to report <unk> earnings of between 15 cents and 19 cents *U* a share , somewhat below analysts ' estimates of 19 cents to 23 cents . 
The maker of scientific instruments and laser parts said 0 orders fell below expectations in recent months . 
A spokesman added that sales in the current quarter will about equal the <unk> quarter 's figure , when Newport reported net income of $ 1.7 million *U* , or 21 cents a share , on $ <unk> million *U* in sales *T* . 
<unk> from the strike by <unk> <unk> union members against Boeing Co. reached air carriers Friday as America West Airlines announced 0 it will postpone its new service out of Houston because of delays in * receiving aircraft from the Seattle jet maker . 
Peter <unk> , vice president for planning at the Phoenix , Ariz. , carrier , said in an interview that the work <unk> at Boeing , now entering its <unk> day , `` has caused some turmoil in our scheduling '' and that more than 500 passengers who *T* were <unk> * to fly out of Houston on America West would now be put * on other airlines . 
Mr. <unk> said 0 Boeing told America West that the <unk> 0 it was supposed * to get *T* this Thursday would n't be delivered * until Nov. 7 -- the day after the airline had been planning * to <unk> service at Houston with four daily flights , including three <unk> to Phoenix and one <unk> to Las Vegas . 
Now , those routes are n't expected * to begin until <unk> . 
Boeing is also supposed * to send to America West another <unk> <unk> aircraft as well as a <unk> by year 's end . 
Those , too , are almost certain * to arrive late . 
At this point , no other America West flights -- including its new service at San Antonio , Texas ; Newark , N.J. ; and <unk> , Calif. -- have been affected * by the delays in Boeing deliveries . 
Nevertheless , the company 's reaction underscores the <unk> effect that a huge manufacturer such as Boeing can have *T* on other parts of the economy . 
It also is sure * to help the machinists put added pressure on the company . 
`` I just do n't feel that the company can really stand <unk> or would want <unk> a prolonged walkout , '' Tom Baker , president of <unk> ' District <unk> , said *T* in an interview yesterday . 
`` I do n't think 0 their customers would like it very much . '' 
America West , though , is a smaller airline and therefore more affected by the delayed delivery of a single plane than many of its competitors would be *?* . 
`` I figure that American and United probably have such a hard time * counting all the planes in their <unk> , 0 they might not miss one at all , '' Mr. <unk> said *T* . 
Indeed , a random check Friday did n't seem * to indicate that the strike was having much of an effect on other airline operations . 
Southwest Airlines has a Boeing <unk> set for delivery at the end of this month and expects * to have the plane on time . 
`` It 's so close to completion , 0 Boeing 's told us 0 there <unk> n't be a problem , '' said *T* a Southwest spokesman . 
A spokesman for AMR Corp. said 0 Boeing has assured American Airlines 0 it will deliver a <unk> on time later this month . 
American is preparing * to take delivery of another <unk> in early December and 20 more next year and is n't <unk> any changes in that timetable . 
In Seattle , a Boeing spokesman explained that the company has been in constant communication with all of its customers and that it <unk> was impossible * to predict what further <unk> *T* might be triggered * by the strike . 
Meanwhile , supervisors and <unk> employees have been trying * to finish some 40 aircraft -- mostly <unk> and <unk> jumbo jets at the company 's <unk> , Wash. , plant -- that *T* were all but completed * before the walkout . 
As of Friday , four had been delivered * and a fifth plane , a <unk> , was supposed * to be flown * out over the weekend to Air China . 
No date <unk> has yet been set * 0 * to get back to the bargaining table *T* . 
`` We want * to make sure 0 they know what they want *T* before they come back , '' said *T* <unk> <unk> , the federal <unk> who *T* has been in contact with both sides since the strike began . 
The investment community , for one , has been <unk> a <unk> resolution . 
Though Boeing 's stock price was battered * along with the rest of the market Friday , it actually has risen over the last two weeks on the strength of new orders . 
`` The market has taken two views : that the labor situation will get settled * in the short term and that things look very <unk> for Boeing in the long term , '' said *T* Howard <unk> , an analyst at <unk> J. Lawrence <unk> . 
Boeing 's shares fell $ 4 *U* Friday * to close at $ <unk> *U* in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange . 
But Mr. Baker said 0 he thinks 0 the earliest 0 a pact could be struck * *T* would be the end of this month , * <unk> that the company and union may resume negotiations as early as this week . 
Still , he said 0 *T* , it <unk> 's possible that the strike could last considerably longer . 
`` I would n't expect an immediate resolution to anything . '' 
Last week , Boeing Chairman Frank <unk> sent striking workers a letter , * saying that `` to my knowledge , Boeing 's offer represents the best overall three-year contract of any major U.S. industrial firm in recent history . '' 
But Mr. Baker called the letter -- and the company 's offer of a 10 % wage increase over the life of the pact , plus bonuses -- `` very weak . '' 
He added that the company <unk> the union 's resolve and the workers ' <unk> with * being forced * to work many hours overtime . 
In separate developments : -- <unk> <unk> have broken off between <unk> representatives at Lockheed Corp. and the <unk> , Calif. , aerospace company . 
The union is continuing * to work through its expired contract , however . 
It had planned a strike vote for next Sunday , but that has been pushed * back indefinitely .

`` <unk> , we 'd like * to be the operator -LCB- of the project -RCB- and a modest equity investor . 
Our long suit is our proven ability * to operate '' power plants , he said 0 *T* . 
Mr. Richardson would n't offer specifics regarding <unk> 's proposed British project , but he said 0 it would compete for customers with two huge British power generating companies that *T* would be formed * under the country 's plan * to <unk> its massive water and electric utilities . 
Britain 's government plans * to raise about # 20 billion *U* -LRB- $ <unk> billion *U* -RRB- from the sale of most of its giant water and electric utilities , beginning next month . 
The planned electric utility sale , scheduled * for next year , is alone expected * to raise # 13 billion *U* , * making it the world 's largest public offering . 
Under terms of the plan , independent <unk> would be able * to compete for 15 % of customers until 1994 , and for another 10 % between 1994 and 1998 . 
Canadian Utilities had 1988 revenue of <unk> <unk> billion *U* , mainly from its natural gas and electric utility businesses in Alberta , where the company serves about 800,000 customers *T* . 
`` There seems * to be a move <unk> around the world * to <unk> the generation of electricity , '' Mr. Richardson said 0 *T* , and Canadian Utilities hopes * to capitalize on it . 
`` This is a real thrust on our utility side , '' he said , * adding that Canadian Utilities is also <unk> projects in <unk> countries , though he would be specific . 
Canadian Utilities is n't alone in * exploring power generation opportunities in Britain , in anticipation of the privatization program . 
`` We 're certainly looking at some power generating projects in England , '' said *T* Bruce <unk> , vice president , corporate strategy and corporate planning , with Enron Corp. , Houston , a big natural gas producer and pipeline operator . 
Mr. <unk> said 0 Enron is considering * building <unk> power plants <unk> in the U.K. capable of * producing about 500 <unk> of power at a cost of about $ 300 million to $ 400 million *U* . 
<unk> Inc. said 0 it expects * to report third earnings of $ 1.3 million to $ 1.7 million *U* , or 14 cents to 18 cents a share . 
In the year-ago quarter , the designer and operator of cogeneration and waste heat recovery plants had net income of $ <unk> *U* , or four cents a share , on revenue of about $ <unk> million *U* . 
The company said 0 the improvement is related to additional cogeneration facilities that *T* have been put * into operation . 
<unk> <unk> flights are $ <unk> *U* to Paris and $ <unk> *U* to London . 
In a <unk> Journal article Oct. 5 , the fares were reversed * . 
Diamond Shamrock <unk> Partners said 0 it had discovered gas offshore Louisiana . 
The well <unk> at a rate of <unk> million cubic feet of gas a day through a 16 <unk> opening at <unk> between <unk> and <unk> feet . 
Diamond Shamrock is the operator , with a 100 % interest in the well . 
Diamond Shamrock <unk> 's stock rose 12.5 cents Friday * to close at $ 8.25 *U* in New York Stock Exchange composite trading . 
Kaufman & <unk> Home Corp. said 0 it formed a $ <unk> million *U* limited partnership subsidiary 0 *T* to buy land in California suitable for residential development . 
The partnership , Kaufman & <unk> Land Development Venture Limited Partnership , is a 50-50 joint venture with a trust created * by institutional clients of <unk> <unk> Corp. , a unit of <unk> Financial Corp. , a real estate advisory , management and development company with offices in Chicago and Beverly Hills , <unk> . 
Kaufman & <unk> , a home building company , declined * to identify the institutional investors . 
The land 0 *T* to be purchased * by the joint venture has n't yet received <unk> and other approvals required * for development , and part of Kaufman & <unk> 's job will be * to obtain such approvals . 
The partnership runs the risk that it may not get the approvals for development , but in return , it can buy land at wholesale rather than retail prices , which *T* can result in sizable savings , said 0 *T* Bruce <unk> , president and chief executive officer of Kaufman & <unk> . 
`` There are really very few companies that *T* have adequate capital 0 * to buy properties in a raw state for cash *T* . 
Typically , developers option property , and then once they get the administrative approvals , they buy it , '' said *T* Mr. <unk> , * adding that he believes 0 the joint venture is the first of its kind . 
`` We usually operate in that conservative manner . '' 
By * setting up the joint venture , Kaufman & <unk> can take the more aggressive approach of * buying raw land , while * avoiding the negative <unk> to its own balance sheet , Mr. <unk> said 0 *T* . 
The company is putting up only 10 % of the capital , although it is responsible for * providing management , planning and processing services to the joint venture . 
`` This is one of the best ways 0 * to assure a pipeline of land 0 *T* to fuel our growth at a minimum risk to our company *T* , '' Mr. <unk> said *T* . 
When the price of plastics took off in 1987 *T* , Quantum Chemical Corp. went along for the ride . 
The timing of Quantum 's chief executive officer , John <unk> <unk> , appeared * to be nothing less than inspired , because he had just increased Quantum 's reliance on plastics . 
The company outpaced much of the chemical industry as annual profit grew <unk> in two years . 
Mr. <unk> said of the boom , 0 `` It 's going * to last a whole lot longer than anybody thinks 0 *?* . '' 
But now prices have <unk> and Quantum 's profit is <unk> . 
Some securities analysts are looking for no better than <unk> results from the company for the third quarter , compared with year-earlier profit of $ <unk> million *U* , or $ <unk> *U* a share , on sales of $ <unk> million *U* . 
The stock , * having lost nearly a quarter of its value since Sept. 1 , closed at $ <unk> *U* share , down $ 1.125 *U* , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday . 
To a degree , Quantum represents the new times that *T* have arrived for producers of the so-called commodity plastics that *T* <unk> modern life . 
* Having just passed through one of the most profitable periods in their history , these producers now see their prices <unk> . 
<unk> <unk> , * to be sure , are nothing new for plastics producers . 
And the financial decline of some looks steep only in comparison with the <unk> period that *T* is just behind them . 
`` We were all wonderful <unk> last year , '' says *T* an executive at one of Quantum 's competitors . 
`` Now we 're at the bottom of the <unk> . '' 
At Quantum , which *T* is based * in New York , the trouble is <unk> * by the company 's heavy dependence on plastics . 
* Once known * as National Distillers & Chemical Corp. , the company <unk> the wine and spirits business and <unk> more of its resources into plastics after Mr. <unk> took the chief executive 's job in 1986 . 
Mr. <unk> , 59 years old , declined * to be interviewed * for this article , but he has consistently argued that over the long <unk> -- across both the <unk> and the <unk> of the plastics market -- Quantum will <unk> through its new direction . 
Quantum 's lot is mostly tied * to <unk> <unk> , used * * to make garbage bags , milk <unk> , <unk> , toys and meat packaging , among other items . 
In the U.S. <unk> market , Quantum has claimed the largest share , about 20 % . 
But its competitors -- including Dow Chemical Co. , Union Carbide Corp. and several oil giants -- have much broader business interests and so are better <unk> * against price swings . 
When the price of <unk> moves a mere penny a pound *T* , Quantum 's annual profit <unk> by about 85 cents a share , provided 0 no other <unk> are changing . 
In recent months the price of <unk> , even more than that of other commodity plastics , has taken a <unk> . 
<unk> <unk> , which *T* still sold for as much as 50 cents a pound last spring , have skidded to between 35 cents and 40 cents . 
Meanwhile , the price of <unk> , the chemical building block of <unk> , has n't dropped nearly so fast . 
That <unk> <unk> Quantum badly , because its own plants cover only about half of its <unk> needs . 
By many accounts , an early hint of a price <unk> in the making came at the start of this year . 
China , which *T* had been putting in huge orders for <unk> , abruptly halted them . 
* <unk> that excess <unk> would soon be <unk> around the world , other buyers then bet that prices had peaked and so began * to draw down inventories rather than order new product . 
Kenneth Mitchell , director of Dow 's <unk> business , says 0 producers were surprised * to learn how much inventories had <unk> throughout the distribution chain as prices <unk> up *T* . 
`` People were even <unk> bags , '' he says *T* . 
Now producers hope 0 prices have hit bottom . 
They recently announced increases of a few cents a pound 0 *T* to take effect in the next several weeks . 
No one knows , however , whether the new posted prices will stick once producers and customers start * to <unk> . 
One <unk> is George <unk> , a <unk> analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. and a bear on plastics stocks . 
* Noting others ' estimates of when price increases can be sustained * *T* , he remarks , 0 `` Some say October . 
Some say November . 
I say 1992 . '' 
He argues that efforts * to firm up prices will be <unk> * by producers ' plans * to expand production capacity . 
A quick turnaround is crucial to Quantum because its cash requirements remain heavy . 
The company is trying * to carry out a three-year , $ 1.3 billion *U* <unk> program started * this year . 
At the same time , its annual payments on long-term debt will more than double from a year ago to about $ 240 million *U* , largely because of debt taken * on * to pay a $ <unk> *U* special dividend earlier this year . 
Quantum described the payout at the time as a way 0 for it to share the <unk> with its holders *T* , because its stock price was n't reflecting the huge profit increases . 
Some analysts saw the payment as an effort * also to <unk> takeover speculation . 
Whether a cash crunch might eventually force the company to cut its quarterly dividend , raised 36 % to 75 cents a share only a year ago , has become a topic of intense speculation on Wall Street since Mr. <unk> <unk> dividend questions in a Sept. 29 meeting with analysts . 
Some viewed his response -- that company directors review the dividend regularly -- as nothing more than the standard line from executives . 
But others came away * thinking 0 he had given something less than his usual <unk> performance . 
In any case , on the day of the meeting , Quantum 's shares slid $ <unk> *U* to $ <unk> *U* in Big Board trading . 
On top of everything else , Quantum <unk> a disaster at its plant in Morris , <unk> . 
After an explosion <unk> the plant in June , the company <unk> in September to within 12 hours of * completing the <unk> process of * <unk> it . 
Then a second explosion occurred . 
Two workers died and six remain in the hospital . 
This human toll adds the most painful <unk> yet to the sudden change in Quantum 's fortunes . 
Until this year , the company had been steadily lowering its accident rate and picking up <unk> safety awards . 
A prolonged production halt at the plant could introduce another <unk> into Quantum 's financial future . 
When a plant has just been running flat out * to meet demand *T* , * <unk> lost profit and thus claims under <unk> insurance is <unk> . 
But the numbers become <unk> -- and subject to <unk> between insured and insurer -- when demand is shifting *T* . 
`` You say 0 you could have sold <unk> percent of this product and <unk> percent of that , '' recalls *T* Theodore <unk> , an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton who *T* went through this exercise during his former career as a chemical engineer . 
`` And then you still have * to negotiate . '' 
Quantum hopes 0 the Morris plant , where limited production got under way last week *T* , will resume full operation by year 's end . 
The plant usually accounts for 20 % to 25 % *U* of Quantum 's <unk> production and 50 % of its <unk> production . 
Not everything looks <unk> for Quantum . 
The plant expansion should strengthen the company 's <unk> in the <unk> business , where market share is often taken * through sheer capacity *T* . 
By * lifting <unk> production , the expansion will also lower the company 's raw material costs . 
Quantum is also tightening its grip on its one large business outside chemicals , <unk> marketing . 
Through a venture with its investment banker , First Boston Corp. , Quantum completed in August an acquisition of <unk> Inc. in a transaction valued * at $ <unk> billion *U* . 
<unk> is the second-largest <unk> distributor in the U.S. . 
The largest , <unk> <unk> , was already owned * by Quantum . 
Still , Quantum has a crisis 0 * to get past *T* right now . 
Some analysts speculate 0 the weakening stock may yet attract a suitor . 
The name <unk> in rumors is British Petroleum Co. , which *T* is looking * to expand its <unk> business in the U.S. . 
* Asked * about a bid for Quantum , a BP spokesman says , `` 0 We pretty much have a policy of * not <unk> on rumors , and I think 0 that falls in that category . 
RJR Nabisco Inc. is <unk> its division responsible for * buying network advertising time , just a month after * moving 11 of the group 's 14 employees to New York from Atlanta . 
A spokesman for the New York-based food and tobacco giant , taken * private earlier this year in a $ 25 billion *U* leveraged buy-out by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. , confirmed that it is <unk> down the RJR Nabisco <unk> unit , and <unk> its 14 employees , in a move * to save money . 
The spokesman said 0 RJR is discussing its <unk> plans with its two main advertising firms , <unk> Katz and <unk> <unk> . 
`` We found with the size of our media purchases that an ad agency could do just as good a job at significantly lower cost , '' said *T* the spokesman , who *T* declined * to specify how much RJR spends *T* on network television time . 
An executive close to the company said 0 RJR is spending about $ 140 million *U* <unk> on network television time this year , down from roughly $ 200 million *U* last year . 
The spokesman said 0 the broadcast unit will be <unk> * Dec. 1 , and the move <unk> n't affect RJR 's print , radio and <unk> buying practices . 
The broadcast group had been based * in New York until a year ago , when RJR 's previous management moved it to Atlanta , the company 's headquarters before this summer *T* . 
One employee with the group said 0 RJR moved 11 employees of the group back to New York in September because `` there was supposed * to be a future . '' 
He said 0 the company hired three more buyers for the unit within the past two weeks , * <unk> them from jobs with advertising agencies . 
The RJR spokesman said 0 the company moved the 11 employees to New York last month because the group had then been in the midst of * purchasing ad time for the networks ' <unk> season . 
`` The studies -LCB- on * closing the unit -RCB- could n't be completed * until now , '' he said *T* . 
The group 's president , Peter <unk> , was n't in his office Friday afternoon * to comment . 
The U.S. , which *T* is <unk> its <unk> quotas , is <unk> a larger share of its steel market to developing and newly industrialized countries which *T* have relatively <unk> steel industries . 
Meanwhile , the U.S. has negotiated a significant cut in Japan 's steel quota , and made only a minor increase to the steel <unk> for the European Community . 
Brazil , similar to Mexico and South Korea , is expected * to negotiate a somewhat bigger share of the U.S. market than it had * under the previous five-year steel quotas , which *T* expired Sept. 30 . 
Brazil and Venezuela are the only two countries that *T* have n't completed steel talks with the U.S. for the year ending Oct. 1 , 1990 . 
In recent years , U.S. steelmakers have supplied about 80 % of the 100 million tons of steel used * annually by the nation . 
Of the remaining 20 % needed * , the <unk> negotiations <unk> about 15 % *T* to foreign suppliers , with the difference supplied * mainly by Canada -- which *T* is n't included * in the quota program . 
Other countries that *T* do n't have formal steel quotas with the U.S. , such as Taiwan , Sweden and Argentina , also have supplied steel . 
Some of these countries have in recent years made informal agreements with the U.S. that *T* are similar to quotas . 
The Bush administration earlier this year said 0 it would extend steel quotas , known * as voluntary restraint agreements , until March 31 , 1992 . 
It also said 0 it would use that <unk> year period * to work toward an international consensus on * <unk> up the international steel trade , which *T* has been <unk> managed , subsidized and protected * by governments . 
The U.S. termed its plan , a `` trade liberalization program , '' despite the fact that it is merely an extension . 
Mexico , which *T* was one of the first countries 0 *T* to conclude its steel talks with the U.S. , virtually doubled its quota to <unk> % of the U.S. steel market from <unk> % under the previous quotas . 
South Korea , which *T* had 1.9 % under the previous quotas , is set * to get a small increase to about <unk> % . 
That increase rises to slightly more than 2 % of the U.S. market if a joint <unk> steel project is included * . 
Meanwhile , Brazil is expected * to increase its allowance from the <unk> % share 0 it has had *T* in recent years . 
The EC and Japan -- the U.S. 's largest steel suppliers -- have n't been filling their quotas to the full extent . 
The EC steel industry , which *T* has been <unk> with strong European demand , has been supplying about 5 % of the U.S. market compared with recent quotas of about 6.7 % . 
Japan has been shipping steel 0 *T* to total about 4.5 % of the U.S. market compared with a quota of 5.9 % . 
In the recent talks , the EC had its quota increased about 300,000 tons , to 7 % of the U.S. market from 6.7 % in 1988 . 
But its quota has been as high as 6.9 % in 1984 . 
Japan , however , has agreed * to cut its quota to about 5 % from 5.9 % previously . 
Japan , the EC , Brazil , Mexico and South Korea provide about 80 % of the steel imported * to the U.S. under the quota program . 
The balance is supplied * by a host of smaller exporters , such as Australia and Venezuela . 
The U.S. had about an extra 2 % of the domestic steel market 0 * to give *T* to foreign suppliers in its quota talks . 
That was essentially made * up of a 1 % increase in the overall quota program and 1 % from * cutting Japan 's allowance . 
<unk> from the White House trade office will repeat these quota negotiations next year when they will have another 1 % of the U.S. steel market 0 * to <unk> *T* *T* . 
These <unk> <unk> increases to the steel quota program are built * into the Bush administration 's <unk> program * to give its negotiators leverage with foreign steel suppliers 0 * to try * to get them to withdraw subsidies and protectionism from their own steel industries *T* . 
<unk> Inc. expects fiscal second-quarter earnings to trail 1988 results , but anticipates that several new products will lead to a `` much stronger '' performance in its second half . 
<unk> , a telecommunications company , had net income of $ <unk> *U* , or five cents a share , in its year-earlier second quarter , ended Sept. 30 . 
Revenue totaled $ 5 million *U* . 
George Pierce , chairman and chief executive officer , said in an interview that earnings in the most recent quarter will be about two cents a share on revenue of just under $ 4 million *U* . 
The lower results , Mr. Pierce said 0 *T* , reflect a <unk> decline in industry sales of privately owned pay telephones , <unk> 's primary business . 
Although Mr. Pierce expects that line of business to strengthen in the next year , he said 0 <unk> will also benefit from * moving into other areas . 
<unk> among those is *T* the company 's entrance into the public <unk> business , Mr. Pierce said 0 *T* . 
Within the next year , <unk> expects * to place 10,000 <unk> machines , made * by <unk> in Japan , in hotels , municipal buildings , <unk> and other public <unk> around the country . 
<unk> will provide a credit-card reader 0 for the machines to collect , store and forward billing data *T* . 
Mr. Pierce said 0 <unk> should realize a minimum of $ 10 *U* of <unk> net earnings for each machine each month . 
<unk> has also developed an automatic call processor that *T* will make further use of the company 's system for * <unk> and handling credit-card calls and collect calls . 
<unk> call processors will provide that system for virtually any telephone , Mr. Pierce said 0 *T* , not just phones produced * by <unk> . 
The company will also be producing a new line of convenience telephones , which *T* do n't accept coins , for use in hotel <unk> , office <unk> , <unk> <unk> and similar <unk> . 
Mr. Pierce estimated that the processors and convenience phones would produce about $ 5 *U* of <unk> net earnings for each machine each month . 
Britain 's retail price index rose 0.7 % in September from August and was up 7.6 % for the year , the Central <unk> Office said 0 *T* . 
<unk> Medical Inc. said 0 it adopted a shareholders ' rights plan in which rights * to purchase shares of common stock will be distributed * as a dividend to shareholders of record as of Oct. 23 *T* . 
The company said 0 the plan was n't adopted * in response to any known offers for <unk> , a maker and marketer of hospital products . 
The rights allow shareholders to purchase <unk> stock at a discount if any person or group acquires more than 15 % of the company 's common stock or <unk> a tender offer . 
<unk> <unk> may soon be replaced * by <unk> in the <unk> room . 
Procter & Gamble Co. plans * to begin * testing next month a <unk> <unk> that *T* will require only a few <unk> per <unk> . 
The move stems from lessons learned * in Japan where local competitors have had <unk> success with concentrated <unk> *T* . 
It also marks P&G 's growing concern that its Japanese rivals , such as <unk> Corp. , may bring their <unk> to the U.S. . 
The Cincinnati <unk> giant got <unk> * two years ago in Japan when <unk> introduced a powerful <unk> , called * <unk> , which *T* quickly won a 30 % stake in the Japanese markets . 
`` They do n't want * to get caught * again , '' says *T* one industry <unk> . 
<unk> in Phoenix , Ariz. , say 0 P&G 's new <unk> <unk> -- 0 *T* to be called * <unk> with <unk> Guard -- will be on shelves in that market by early November . 
A P&G spokeswoman confirmed that shipments to Phoenix started late last month . 
She said 0 the company will study results from this market before * expanding to others . 
<unk> are n't entirely new for P&G . 
The company introduced a <unk> <unk> <unk> in Japan after * watching the success of <unk> . 
When <unk> hit the shelves in 1987 *T* , P&G 's share of the Japanese market fell to about 8 % from more than 20 % . 
With the help of <unk> <unk> , P&G 's share is now estimated * to be 12 % . 
While the Japanese have <unk> the compact packaging and convenience of concentrated products , the true test for P&G will be in the $ 4 billion *U* U.S. <unk> market , where growth is slow *T* and <unk> have gained <unk> over <unk> *T* . 
The company may have chosen * to market the product under the <unk> name since it 's already expanded its <unk> <unk> into 16 different <unk> , including this year 's big hit , <unk> with <unk> . 
With <unk> , however , it <unk> is n't always easy * to persuade consumers that less is more ; many people tend * to dump too much <unk> into the <unk> machine , * believing that it <unk> takes a <unk> of <unk> * to really clean the <unk> . 
In the early 1980s , P&G tried * to launch here a concentrated <unk> under the <unk> brand name that it markets *T* in Europe . 
But the product , which *T* was n't as concentrated as the new <unk> , <unk> in a market test in Denver and was dropped * . 
P&G and others also have tried repeatedly * to <unk> consumers on <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> , but they have n't sold well , despite the convenience . 
But P&G contends 0 the new <unk> is a unique formula that *T* also offers an <unk> that *T* prevents colors from * <unk> . 
And retailers are expected * to embrace the product , in part because it will take up less shelf space . 
`` When shelf space was cheap *T* , bigger was better , '' says Hugh <unk> , an analyst at Salomon <unk> . 
But with so many brands <unk> for space , that 's no longer the case . 
If the new <unk> sells well , the trend toward smaller packaging is likely * to accelerate as competitors follow with their own <unk> . 
Then retailers `` will probably push the -LCB- <unk> -RCB- brands out altogether , '' he says 0 *T* . 
<unk> is bound * to get tougher if <unk> <unk> a product like <unk> in the U.S. . 
* To be sure , <unk> would n't have an easy time * taking U.S. market share away from the <unk> P&G , which *T* has about 23 % of the market . 
<unk> officials previously have said 0 they are interested in * selling <unk> in the U.S. , but so far the company has focused on acquisitions , such as last year 's purchase of Andrew <unk> Co. , a Cincinnati <unk> maker . 
It also has a <unk> facility in California . 
Some believe 0 P&G 's interest in a <unk> <unk> goes beyond the concern for the Japanese . 
`` This is something 0 P&G would do *T* with or without <unk> , '' says *T* Mr. <unk> . 
With economic tension between the U.S. and Japan worsening , many Japanese had feared last week 's visit from U.S. Trade Representative <unk> Hills . 
They expected a new <unk> of demands that Japan do something quickly * to reduce its trade surplus with the U.S. . 
Instead , they got a discussion of the need for the U.S. and Japan to work together and of the importance of the long-term view . 
Mrs. Hills ' first trip to Japan as America 's chief trade negotiator had a completely different tone from last month 's visit by Commerce Secretary Robert A. <unk> . 
Mr. <unk> called for concrete results by next spring in negotiations over fundamental Japanese business practices that *T* supposedly <unk> free trade . 
He said 0 such results should be `` <unk> in dollars and cents '' in * reducing the U.S. trade deficit with Japan . 
But Mrs. Hills , * speaking at a breakfast meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan on Saturday , stressed that the objective `` is not * to get definitive action by spring or summer , it is rather * to have a <unk> for action . '' 
She added that she expected `` * perhaps to have a down payment <unk> some small step 0 *T* to convince the American people and the Japanese people that we 're moving in <unk> . '' 
How such remarks translate into policy *T* <unk> n't become clear for months . 
American and Japanese officials offered several theories for the difference in approach <unk> Mr. <unk> and Mrs. Hills . 
Many called it simply a contrast in styles . 
But some saw it as a classic negotiating tactic . 
Others said 0 the Bush administration may feel 0 the rhetoric on both sides is getting out of hand . 
And some said 0 it reflected the growing debate in Washington over * pursuing free trade with Japan <unk> some kind of managed trade . 
* Asked * * to compare her visit to Mr. <unk> 's , Mrs. Hills replied : 0 `` I did n't hear every word 0 he spoke *T* , but as a general <unk> , I think 0 we have a very consistent trade strategy in the Bush administration . '' 
Yet more than one American official who *T* sat in with her during three days of talks with Japanese officials said 0 her tone often was surprisingly `` <unk> . '' 
`` I think 0 my line has been very consistent , '' Mrs. Hills said *T* at a news conference Saturday afternoon . 
`` I am painted * sometimes as <unk> , perhaps because I have a <unk> list of statutes 0 * to implement *T* . 
I do n't feel very <unk> . 
I do n't feel either hard or soft . 
I feel committed to the program of * opening markets and expanding trade . '' 
When she met the local press for the first time on Friday *T* , Mrs. Hills firmly reiterated the need for progress in * removing barriers to trade in forest products , satellites and <unk> , three areas targeted * under the Super <unk> provision of the 1988 trade bill . 
She <unk> <unk> business practices that the U.S. government has identified *T* . 
But her main thrust was * to promote the importance of world-wide free trade and open competition . 
She said 0 the trade imbalance was mainly due to <unk> factors and should n't be <unk> * by * setting <unk> targets . 
At her news conference for Japanese reporters , one economics journalist <unk> up the Japanese sense of relief . 
`` My impression was that you would be a <unk> old lady , '' he said *T* , * drawing a few nervous <unk> from his colleagues . 
`` But I am relieved * to see that you are beautiful and <unk> and intelligent and a person of integrity . '' 
Mrs. Hills ' remarks did raise questions , at least among some U.S. officials , about what exactly her stance <unk> is *T* on U.S. access to the Japanese semiconductor market . 
The U.S. share of the Japanese market has been stuck * around 10 % for years . 
Many Americans have interpreted a 1986 agreement as * <unk> U.S. companies a 20 % share by 1991 , but the Japanese have denied * making any such promise . 
At one of her news <unk> , Mrs. Hills said , 0 `` I believe 0 we can do much better than 20 % . '' 
But she stressed , 0 `` I am against managed trade . 
I will not enter into an agreement that *T* <unk> to a percentage of the market . 
<unk> Industries Inc. said 0 it expects * to report a net loss for the fourth quarter that *T* ended June 30 and is seeking new financing . 
The seller of <unk> products and services said 0 it is considering a number of financing alternatives , including * seeking increases in its credit lines . 
<unk> declined * to estimate the amount of the loss and would n't say if it expects * to show a profit for the year . 
In the year ended June 30 , 1988 , <unk> reported net income of $ 4.9 million *U* , or $ <unk> *U* a share . 
The company did n't break out its fourth-quarter results . 
In the latest nine months net income was $ 4.7 million *U* , or $ <unk> *U* a share , on revenue of $ <unk> million *U* . 
Separately , the company said 0 it would file a delayed <unk> report with the Securities and Exchange Commission `` within approximately 45 days . '' 
It said 0 the delay resulted from difficulties in * resolving its accounting of a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission . 
Under an agreement <unk> filed * in federal court in August * to settle FTC objections to some <unk> sales practices , <unk> said 0 it would establish a $ 250,000 *U* trust fund 0 *T* to provide refunds to certain customers . 
Information International Inc. said 0 it was sued * by a buyer of its computerized <unk> system , alleging that the company failed * to correct <unk> in the system . 
A spokesman for Information International said 0 the lawsuit by two units of Morris Communications Corp. seeks <unk> of the system 's about $ 3 million *U* purchase price and cancellation of a software license provided * by the Morris units to Information International for alleged failure * to pay royalties . 
Information International said 0 it believes that the complaints , * filed * in federal court in Georgia , are without merit . 
<unk> held Morris Communications is based * in <unk> , <unk> . 
The units that *T* filed the suit are <unk> <unk> Corp. and Florida Publishing <unk> . 
<unk> Corp. completed the sale of its A. <unk> & Co. subsidiary , a men 's luxury <unk> , to <unk> Investments . 
Terms were n't disclosed * . 
As <unk> 's `` core business of <unk> retailing grows , a small subsidiary that *T* is <unk> unrelated becomes a difficult <unk> , '' said *T* <unk> <unk> , president of the parent , in a statement . 
A spokeswoman said 0 <unk> operates a total of seven stores in the U.S. and overseas . 
<unk> operates 25 <unk> apparel stores in the U.S. . 
The oil industry 's <unk> profits could persist through the rest of the year . 
Major oil companies in the next few days are expected * to report much less robust earnings than they did *?* for the third quarter a year ago , largely reflecting deteriorating chemical prices and gasoline profitability . 
The gasoline picture may improve this quarter , but chemicals are likely * to remain weak , industry executives and analysts say 0 *T* , * reducing chances that profits could equal their year-earlier performance . 
The industry is `` seeing a softening somewhat in volume and certainly in price in <unk> , '' Glenn Cox , president of Phillips Petroleum Co. , said 0 *T* in an interview . 
`` That change will obviously impact third and fourth quarter earnings '' for the industry in general , he added 0 *T* . 
He did n't forecast Phillips 's results . 
But securities analysts say 0 Phillips will be among the companies <unk> by weak chemical prices and will probably post a drop in third-quarter earnings . 
So , too , many analysts predict 0 *T* , will *?* *T* Exxon Corp. , Chevron Corp. and Amoco <unk> . 
Typical is *T* what *T* happened to the price of <unk> , a major commodity chemical produced * in vast amounts by many oil companies . 
It has plunged 13 % since July to around 26 cents a pound . 
A year ago <unk> sold for 33 cents , * <unk> at about 34 cents last December . 
A big reason for the chemical price retreat is <unk> . 
<unk> in <unk> , prices began * accelerating as a growing U.S. economy and the weak dollar spurred demand . 
Companies added capacity <unk> . 
Now , greatly increased supplies are on the market , while the dollar is stronger , and domestic economic growth is slower . 
<unk> profits from gasoline were weaker . 
`` <unk> margins were so good in the third quarter of last year and generally not very good this year , '' said *T* William <unk> , a securities analyst at First Boston <unk> . 
Oil company refineries ran flat out * to prepare for a robust holiday driving season in July and August that *T* did n't <unk> . 
The excess supply pushed gasoline prices down in that period . 
In addition , crude oil prices were up some from a year earlier , * further <unk> profitability . 
<unk> say 0 margins picked up in September , and many industry officials believe 0 gasoline profits will rebound this quarter , though still not to the level of 1988 's fourth quarter . 
During the 1988 second half , many companies posted record gasoline and chemical profits . 
<unk> oil production may turn out * to be the most surprising element of companies ' earnings this year . 
Prices -- * averaging roughly $ 2 *U* a barrel higher in the third quarter than a year earlier -- have stayed well above most companies ' expectations . 
Demand has been much stronger than * anticipated * , and it typically <unk> in the fourth quarter . 
`` We could see higher oil prices this year , '' said *T* Bryan <unk> , an analyst at PaineWebber <unk> . 
That will translate into sharply higher production profits , particularly compared with last year when oil prices steadily fell to below $ 13 *U* a barrel in the fourth quarter *T* . 
While oil prices have been better than * expected * , natural gas prices have been worse . 
In the third quarter , they averaged about 5 % less than they were *?* in 1988 . 
The main reason remains weather . 
Last summer was notable for a heat wave and drought that *T* caused utilities to burn more natural gas * to feed increased electrical demand from air <unk> use . 
This summer , on the other hand , had <unk> weather than usual . 
`` We 've been very disappointed in the performance of natural gas prices , '' said *T* Mr. Cox , Phillips 's president . 
`` The lagging gas price is not going * to assist fourth quarter performance as many had expected 0 *?* . '' 
* <unk> into the fourth quarter , natural gas prices are anywhere from 8 % to 17 % *U* lower than a year earlier . 
For instance , natural gas currently produced * along the Gulf Coast is selling on the spot market for around $ <unk> *U* a thousand cubic feet , down 13 % from $ <unk> *U* a thousand cubic feet a year ago . 
The Bush administration , * trying * to blunt growing demands from Western Europe for a <unk> of controls on exports to the Soviet bloc , is questioning whether Italy 's <unk> . C. Olivetti & Co. supplied <unk> valuable technology to the Soviets . 
Most of the Western European members of <unk> Committee on <unk> Export Controls , the <unk> forum through which the U.S. and its allies <unk> their <unk> policies *T* , are expected * to argue for more liberal export rules at a meeting 0 *T* to be held * in Paris Oct. 25 and 26 . 
They plan * to press specifically for a <unk> of rules governing exports of machine tools , computers and other high-technology products . 
But the Bush administration says 0 it wants * to see evidence that all <unk> members are <unk> fully with existing <unk> procedures before it will support further liberalization . 
* To make its point , it is challenging the Italian government * to explain reports that Olivetti may have supplied the Soviet Union with sophisticated <unk> devices that *T* could be used * * to build parts for combat aircraft . 
The London Sunday Times , which *T* first reported the U.S. concerns , cited a U.S. intelligence report as the source of the allegations that Olivetti exported $ 25 million *U* in `` <unk> , <unk> , flexible manufacturing systems to the Soviet aviation industry . '' 
Olivetti reportedly began * shipping these tools in 1984 . 
A State Department spokesman acknowledged that the U.S. is discussing the allegations with the Italian government and <unk> , but declined * to confirm any details . 
Italian President <unk> <unk> promised a quick investigation into whether Olivetti broke <unk> rules . 
President Bush called his attention to the matter during the Italian leader 's visit here last week . 
Olivetti has denied that it violated <unk> rules , * asserting that the reported shipments were properly licensed * by the Italian authorities . 
Although the <unk> of these sales is still an open question , the disclosure could n't be better <unk> * * to support the position of <unk> <unk> in the Pentagon and the intelligence community . 
`` It seems to me that a story like this breaks just before every important <unk> meeting , '' said *T* a Washington lobbyist for a number of U.S. computer companies . 
The Bush administration has sent conflicting signals about its <unk> policies , * reflecting <unk> divisions among several competing agencies . 
Last summer , Mr. Bush moved the administration in the direction of gradual liberalization when he told a North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting that he would allow some exceptions to the <unk> embargo of strategic goods *T* . 
But more recently , the Pentagon and the Commerce Department openly <unk> over the extent to which <unk> should <unk> exports of personal computers to the bloc *T* . 
However , these agencies generally agree that the West should be cautious about any further liberalization . 
`` There 's no evidence that the Soviet program 0 *T* to -LRB- illegally -RRB- acquire Western technology has diminished , '' said *T* a State Department spokesman . 
Salomon Brothers International Ltd. , a British subsidiary of Salomon Inc. , announced 0 it will issue warrants on shares of Hong Kong Telecommunications <unk> . 
The move closely follows a similar offer by Salomon of warrants for shares of Hongkong & Shanghai Banking <unk> . 
Under the latest offer , <unk> 62.5 million *U* -LRB- <unk> 8 million *U* -RRB- of three-year warrants will be issued * in London , each giving buyers the right * to buy one Hong Kong Telecommunications share at a price 0 *T* to be determined * Friday . 
The 50 million warrants will be priced * at <unk> 1.25 *U* each and are expected * to carry a premium to the share price of about 26 % . 
In trading on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong , the shares closed Wednesday at <unk> <unk> *U* each . 
At this price , the shares would have * to rise above <unk> <unk> *U* for subscribers to Salomon 's issue to <unk> convert their warrants . 
While Hong Kong companies have in the past issued warrants on their own shares , Salomon 's warrants are the first here 0 *T* to be issued * by a third party . 
Salomon will `` cover '' the warrants by * buying sufficient shares , or options 0 * to purchase shares *T* , 0 *T* to cover its entire position . 
Bankers said 0 warrants for Hong Kong stocks are attractive because they give foreign investors , wary of volatility in the colony 's stock market , an opportunity * to buy shares without * taking too great a risk . 
The Hong Kong Telecommunications warrants should be attractive to buyers in Europe , the bankers added 0 *T* , because the group is one of a handful of blue-chip stocks on the Hong Kong market that *T* has international appeal . 
Financial Corp. of Santa Barbara filed suit against former stock <unk> Ivan F. Boesky and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , * charging 0 they <unk> the thrift by * <unk> their relationship when * <unk> it * to buy $ <unk> million *U* in high-yield , high-risk junk bonds *T* . 
In a suit filed * in federal court Thursday , the S&L alleged that a `` <unk> number '' of the bonds 0 it purchased *T* in 1984 declined in value . 
Financial Corp. purchased the bonds , the suit alleged 0 *T* , after Mr. Boesky and Drexel negotiated an agreement for <unk> Hotels to purchase a 51 % stake in the thrift for about $ 34 million *U* . 
<unk> Hotels was controlled * by Mr. Boesky , who *T* currently is serving a prison term for securities violations . 
Officials at Drexel said 0 they had n't seen the suit and thus could n't comment . 
In addition to $ 33 million *U* <unk> damages , the suit seeks $ 100 million *U* in punitive damages . 
Also named * in the suit is *T* Ivan F. Boesky Corp. and <unk> Corp. , the successor company to <unk> Hotels . 
<unk> officials could n't be located * . 
Financial Corp. said 0 it agreed * to buy the bonds after a representative of Ivan F. Boesky Corp. visited it in November 1983 and said 0 Financial Corp. could improve its financial condition by * purchasing the bonds . 
Shortly before the visit , Mr. Boesky and Drexel <unk> had met with Financial Corp. officials and had signed a letter of intent * to acquire the 51 % stake in the company . 
However , the agreement was canceled * in June 1984 . 
Financial Corp. purchased the bonds in at least 70 different transactions in 1984 and since then has realized $ 11 million *U* in losses on them , the company said 0 *T* . 
<unk> <unk> Industries Inc. said 0 its directors reached an agreement in principle calling for <unk> North America Inc. to combine its North American cement holdings with <unk> in a transaction that *T* will leave <unk> 's minority shareholders with 12.8 % of the combined company . 
<unk> , the North American holding company of Swiss concern <unk> <unk> <unk> Ltd. , previously proposed * combining its 100 % stake in St. Lawrence <unk> Inc. and its 60 % stake in <unk> <unk> Co. with its 67 % stake in <unk> . 
But <unk> 's first offer would have given <unk> 's other shareholders about 10 % of the combined company . 
<unk> 's directors rejected that offer , although they said 0 they endorsed the merger proposal . 
Under the agreement , <unk> will own <unk> % of the combined company . 
<unk> 's current operations will represent about <unk> % of the combined company . 
The transaction is subject to a definitive agreement and approval by <unk> shareholders . 
<unk> said 0 it expects * to complete the transaction early next year . 
While corn and soybean prices have slumped well below their <unk> <unk> of 1988 , wheat prices remain <unk> high . 
And they 're likely * to stay that way for months 0 *T* to come , analysts say 0 *T* . 
For one thing , even with many farmers <unk> more winter wheat <unk> this year than last , tight wheat supplies are likely * to support prices well into 1990 , the analysts say 0 *T* . 
And if rain does n't fall soon across many of the Great Plains ' <unk> areas , yields in the crop now being planted * could be reduced * , * further <unk> supplies . 
Also supporting prices are *T* expectations that the Soviet Union will place substantial buying orders over the next few months . 
By next May 31 , stocks of U.S. wheat 0 *T* to be carried over into the next season -- before the winter wheat now being planted * is <unk> * -- are projected * to drop to <unk> million bushels . 
That would be the lowest level since the early 1970s . 
Stocks were <unk> million bushels on May 31 of this year . 
In response to <unk> domestic supplies , Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter last month said 0 the U.S. government would slightly increase the number of acres 0 farmers can plant *T* in wheat for next year and still qualify for federal support payments . 
The government estimates that the new plan will boost production next year by about 66 million bushels . 
It now estimates production for next year at just under 2.6 billion bushels , compared with this year 's estimated <unk> billion and a <unk> <unk> billion in 1988 . 
But the full effect on prices of the winter wheat now being planted * <unk> n't be felt * until the second half of next year . 
Until then , limited stocks are likely * to keep prices near the $ <unk> *U* level , analysts say 0 *T* . 
On the Chicago Board of Trade Friday , wheat for December delivery settled at $ <unk> *U* a bushel , unchanged . 
In theory at least , tight supplies next spring could leave the wheat futures market <unk> to a <unk> squeeze , said *T* Daniel <unk> , a futures analyst with <unk> Co. in Chicago . 
Such a situation can <unk> <unk> , as * was shown * by the emergency that *T* developed in soybean futures trading this summer on the Chicago Board of Trade . 
In July , the <unk> ordered Ferruzzi <unk> <unk> . A. * to liquidate futures positions equal to about 23 million bushels of soybeans . 
The exchange said 0 it feared that some members would n't be able * to find enough soybeans * to deliver and would have * to default on their <unk> obligation to the Italian conglomerate , which *T* had refused requests * to reduce its holdings . 
Ferruzzi has denied 0 it was trying * to <unk> the soybean futures market . 
<unk> hot , dry weather across large portions of the Great Plains and in <unk> areas in Washington and Oregon is threatening * to reduce the yield from this season 's winter wheat crop , said 0 *T* <unk> Leslie , a futures analyst and head of Leslie Analytical in Chicago . 
For example , in the Oklahoma <unk> , 40 % or more of the <unk> is short of <unk> . 
That figure <unk> to about 47 % in <unk> portions of Kansas , he said 0 *T* . 
The Soviet Union has n't given any clear indication of its wheat purchase plans , but many analysts expect Moscow to place sizable orders for U.S. wheat in the next few months , * further supporting prices . 
`` Wheat prices will increasingly <unk> off of Soviet demand '' in coming weeks , predicted 0 *T* Richard <unk> , vice president , research , for <unk> Inc. in Chicago . 
* Looking ahead to other commodity markets this week : 
Orange <unk> Traders will be watching * to see how long and how far the price decline that *T* began Friday will go *T* . 
Late Thursday , after the close of trading , the market received what *T* would normally have been a bullish U.S. Department of Agriculture estimate of the <unk> Florida orange crop . 
It was near the low range of estimates , at 130 million <unk> boxes , compared with <unk> million boxes last season . 
However , as * expected * , Brazil waited for the crop estimate to come out and then cut the export price of its juice concentrate to about $ <unk> *U* a pound from around $ <unk> *U* . 
Friday 's <unk> selling of futures contracts <unk> whatever <unk> effect the U.S. report might have had *T* and sent the November orange juice contract down as much as <unk> cents a pound at one time . 
It settled with a loss of <unk> cents at $ <unk> *U* a pound . 
Brazilian juice , after a delay caused * by drought at the start of its crop season , is beginning * to arrive in the U.S. in large quantities . 
Brazil wants * to stimulate demand for its product , which *T* is going * to be in <unk> supply . 
The price cut , one analyst said 0 *T* , appeared * to be aimed * even more at Europe , where consumption of Brazilian juice has fallen *T* . 
It 's a <unk> product , and the strong dollar has made it more expensive in Europe , the analyst said 0 *T* . 
New York futures prices have dropped significantly from more than $ 2 *U* a pound at <unk> . 
<unk> a cold <unk> or other crop problems in the growing areas , downward pressure on prices is likely * to continue into January , when <unk> and processing of <unk> in Florida reach their peak *T* , the analyst said 0 *T* . 
Energy 
Although some analysts look for profit-taking in the wake of Friday 's leap in crude oil prices , last week 's rally is generally expected * to continue this week . 
`` I would continue * to look for a stable crude market , at least in futures '' trading , said *T* William <unk> , an energy futures broker with <unk> & <unk> . 
Friday capped a week of steadily rising crude oil prices in both futures and spot markets . 
On the New York Mercantile Exchange , West Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery finished at $ <unk> *U* a barrel , up 42 cents on the day . 
On European markets , meanwhile , spot prices of North Sea <unk> were up 35 to 75 cents a barrel . 
`` This market still wants * to go higher , '' said *T* <unk> <unk> , a first vice president at Shearson Lehman Hutton <unk> . 
He predicted that the November contract will reach $ <unk> *U* <unk> a barrel or more on the New York Mercantile Exchange . 
There has been little news 0 *T* to account for such <unk> in the oil markets . 
Analysts generally cite a lack of bearish developments as well as rumors of a possible tightening of supplies of some <unk> and <unk> . 
There also are <unk> reports that the Soviet Union is having difficulties with its oil exports and that Nigeria has about reached its production limit and <unk> n't produce as much as it could sell *?* . 
Many traders <unk> a tightening of near-term supplies , particularly of high-quality <unk> such as those produced * in the North Sea and in Nigeria . 
If a hostile <unk> <unk> emerges for Saatchi & Saatchi Co. , <unk> Charles and <unk> Saatchi will lead a management buy-out attempt , an official close to the company said 0 *T* . 
<unk> for any takeover attempt may be <unk> in the wake of Friday 's stock-market sell-off in New York and turmoil in the junk-bond market . 
But the <unk> British advertising and consulting giant , which *T* last week named a new chief executive officer 0 *T* to replace <unk> Saatchi , has been the subject of intense takeover speculation for weeks . 
Last week , Saatchi 's largest shareholder , <unk> Asset Management , said 0 it had been approached * by one or more third parties interested in a possible restructuring . 
And Carl <unk> , chief executive officer of Saatchi 's big <unk> <unk> <unk> advertising unit , said 0 he had offered * to lead a management buy-out of the company , but was rebuffed * by Charles Saatchi . 
Mr. <unk> said 0 he would n't launch a hostile bid . 
The executive close to Saatchi & Saatchi said that `` if a bidder came up with a <unk> high offer , a crazy offer which Saatchi knew 0 it could n't beat *T* , it would have no choice but * to recommend it to shareholders . 
But -LCB- otherwise -RCB- it would undoubtedly come back '' with an offer by management . 
The executive said 0 any buy-out would be led * by the current board , whose chairman *T* is <unk> Saatchi and whose strategic <unk> force *T* is believed * to be Charles Saatchi . 
Mr. <unk> is n't part of the board , nor are *?* any of the other heads of Saatchi 's big <unk> ad agencies . 
The executive did n't name any price , but securities analysts have said 0 Saatchi would fetch upward of $ 1.3 billion *U* . 
The executive denied speculation that Saatchi was bringing in the new chief executive officer * only to clean up the company financially so that the brothers could lead a buy-back . 
That speculation <unk> Friday as industry executives <unk> the appointment of the new chief executive , Robert <unk> , who *T* <unk> Saatchi and becomes a member of its board on Jan. 1 . 
Mr. <unk> , formerly chief executive of the pharmaceutical research firm <unk> International Inc. , has a reputation as a <unk> financial manager , and will be charged * largely with * <unk> Saatchi 's poor financial state . 
* Asked * about the speculation that Mr. <unk> has been hired * * to <unk> the way for a buy-out by the brothers , the executive replied , `` That is n't the reason 0 Dreyfus has been brought * in *T* . 
He was brought * in * to turn around the company . '' 
Separately , several Saatchi agency clients said 0 they believe 0 the company 's management <unk> will have little affect on them . 
`` It has n't had any impact on us , nor do we expect it to *?* , '' said *T* a spokeswoman for Miller <unk> Co. , a major client of <unk> <unk> .

Executives at <unk> <unk> client <unk> Inc. , as well as at Saatchi client Philips Lighting Co. , also said 0 they saw no effect . 
Executives at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. , a <unk> <unk> client that *T* is reviewing its account , declined comment .

Revenue gained 5.3 % to $ <unk> million *U* from $ <unk> million *U* . 
The drop in profit reflected , in part , continued <unk> in financial advertising at The Wall Street Journal and Barron 's magazine . 
<unk> <unk> at the Journal fell 6.1 % in the third quarter . 
<unk> Publications Inc. reversed a year-earlier third quarter net loss . 
The publisher of the Boston <unk> reported net of $ 8.5 million *U* , or 12 cents a share , compared with a loss of $ <unk> million *U* , or 38 cents a share , for the third quarter in 1988 . 
William O. Taylor , the parent 's chairman and chief executive officer , said 0 earnings continued * to be hurt * by <unk> in ad volume at the Boston newspaper . 
<unk> profit estimates for several companies are being strongly affected * by the price of newsprint , which *T* in the last two years has had several price increases . 
After a supply crunch caused prices to rise 14 % since 1986 to $ 650 *U* a metric ton , analysts are encouraged , because they do n't expect a price increase for the rest of this year . 
Companies with daily newspapers in the Northeast will need the stable newsprint prices * to ease damage from weak ad <unk> . 
Mr. <unk> at Salomon Brothers said 0 he estimates that Times Mirror Co. 's earnings were down for the third quarter , because of soft advertising levels at its Long Island <unk> and Hartford <unk> newspapers . 
<unk> on the East Coast was likely offset * by improved ad <unk> at the Los Angeles Times , which *T* this week also unveiled a <unk> . 
New York Times Co. is expected * to report lower earnings for the third quarter because of continued weak advertising levels at its flagship New York Times and deep discounting of newsprint at its affiliate , Forest Products Group . 
`` Times Co. 's regional daily newspapers are holding up well , but there is little sign that things will improve in the New York market , '' said *T* Alan <unk> , an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton . 
Washington Post Co. is expected * to report improved earnings , largely because of increased cable revenue and publishing revenue helped * by an improved retail market in the Washington area . 
According to analysts , profits were also helped * by successful cost-cutting measures at <unk> . 
The <unk> has faced heightened competition from rival Time magazine and a relatively flat magazine advertising market . 
Knight-Ridder Inc. is faced * with continued uncertainty over the pending joint operating agreement between its Detroit Free Press and Gannett 's Detroit News , and has told analysts that earnings were down in the third quarter . 
However , analysts point to positive advertising spending at several of its major daily newspapers , such as the Miami Herald and San Jose Mercury News . 
`` The Miami market is coming back strong after a tough couple of years '' when Knight-Ridder `` was starting up a Hispanic edition *T* and circulation was falling *T* , '' said *T* Bruce <unk> , an analyst for <unk> National Bank . 
General Motors Corp. , in a series of moves that *T* angered union officials in the U.S. and Canada , has signaled that as many as five North American assembly plants may not survive the <unk> as the corporation <unk> * to cut its excess <unk> capacity . 
In announcements to workers late last week , GM effectively signed death notices for two <unk> van assembly plants , and cast serious doubt on the futures of three U.S. car factories . 
GM is under intense pressure * to close factories that *T* became unprofitable as the giant auto maker 's U.S. market share skidded during the past decade . 
The company , * currently using about 80 % of its North American vehicle capacity , has vowed 0 it will run at 100 % of capacity by 1992 . 
Just a month ago , GM announced 0 it would make an aging assembly plant in <unk> , Ga. , the eighth U.S. assembly facility 0 *T* to close since 1987 . 
Now , GM appears * to be stepping up the pace of its factory consolidation * to get in shape for the 1990s . 
One reason is mounting competition from new Japanese car plants in the U.S. that *T* are <unk> out more than one million vehicles a year at costs lower than GM can match *?* . 
Another is that United Auto Workers union officials have signaled 0 they want tighter <unk> provisions in the new Big Three national contract that *T* will be negotiated * next year . 
GM officials want * to get their strategy 0 * to reduce capacity and the work force *T* in place before those talks begin . 
The problem , however , is that GM 's moves are coming at a time when UAW leaders are trying * to silence dissidents who *T* charge 0 the union is too passive in the face of GM layoffs *T* . 
Against that <unk> , UAW Vice President Stephen P. <unk> , who *T* recently became head of the union 's GM department , issued a statement <unk> Friday <unk> GM 's `` <unk> <unk> '' toward union members . 
The auto maker 's decision * to let word of the latest <unk> and product <unk> <unk> out in separate <unk> to the affected plants showed `` <unk> '' and an `` inability or <unk> * to provide consistent information , '' Mr. <unk> said 0 *T* . 
GM officials told workers late last week of the following moves : Production of <unk> <unk> will be consolidated * into a single plant in <unk> , <unk> . 
That means 0 two plants -- one in <unk> , Ontario , and the other in <unk> , Ohio -- probably will be shut * down after the end of 1991 . 
The <unk> will idle about 3,000 Canadian assembly workers and about 2,500 workers in Ohio . 
Robert White , Canadian Auto Workers union president , used the impending <unk> shutdown * to criticize the <unk> free trade agreement and its champion , Prime Minister Brian Mulroney . 
But Canadian auto workers may benefit from a separate GM move that *T* affects three U.S. car plants and one in Quebec . 
Workers at plants in Van <unk> , Calif. , Oklahoma City and Pontiac , Mich. , were told * 0 their facilities are no longer being considered * to build the next generation of the Pontiac <unk> and Chevrolet <unk> muscle cars . 
GM is studying whether it can build the new <unk> <unk> at a plant in St. <unk> , Quebec , company and union officials said 0 *T* . 
That announcement left union officials in Van <unk> and Oklahoma City uncertain about their futures . 
The Van <unk> plant , which *T* employs about 3,000 workers , does n't have a product 0 * to build *T* after 1993 . 
Jerry <unk> , UAW local president , said 0 the facility was asked * * to draw up plans * to continue * working as a `` <unk> plant , '' which *T* could build several different types of products on short notice * to satisfy demand . 
At the Oklahoma City plant , which *T* employs about 6,000 workers building the <unk> <unk> <unk> cars , Steve <unk> , UAW local vice president , said 0 the plant has no new product lined * up , and `` 0 none of us knows '' when the <unk> cars will die *T* . 
He said 0 he believes 0 GM has plans * to keep * building <unk> cars into the <unk> . 
At Pontiac , however , the <unk> decision appears * to <unk> UAW hopes that GM would reopen the <unk> assembly plant that *T* last built the <unk> , <unk> Pontiac <unk> model . 
The <unk> plant was viewed * as a model of <unk> cooperation at GM before slow sales of the <unk> forced the company to close the factory last year . 
Union officials have taken a beating politically as a result . 
<unk> UAW members have used the <unk> plant as a symbol of <unk> cooperation 's failure . 
<unk> <unk> S.A. of France said 0 the Canadian government raised an obstacle to its proposed acquisition of <unk> <unk> Inc. for <unk> million Canadian dollars -LRB- <unk> <unk> million *U* -RRB- . 
<unk> said 0 the government 's minister of industry , science and technology told it that he was n't convinced that the purchase is likely * to be of `` net benefit '' to Canada . 
Canadian investment rules require that big foreign takeovers meet that standard . 
The French company said 0 the government gave it 30 days in which * to submit information 0 *T* to further support its takeover plan *T* . 
Both <unk> and <unk> are biotechnology research and vaccine manufacturing concerns . 
The government 's action was unusual . 
Alan <unk> , executive vice president of Investment Canada , which *T* oversees foreign takeovers , said 0 it marked the first time in its four-year history that the agency has made an adverse <unk> decision about the acquisition of a publicly traded company *T* . 
He said 0 it has reached the same conclusions about some attempts * to buy closely held concerns , but eventually allowed those acquisitions to proceed . 
`` This is n't a change in government policy ; this provision has been used * before , '' said *T* <unk> <unk> , press secretary for <unk> <unk> , Canada 's minister of industry , science and technology . 
Mr. <unk> issued the ruling based on a recommendation by Investment Canada . 
Spokesmen for <unk> and <unk> said 0 they had n't been informed * of specific areas of concern by either the government or Investment Canada , but added 0 they hope * to have more information early this week . 
Investment Canada declined * to comment on the reasons for the government decision . 
<unk> <unk> , a partner with <unk> & <unk> , a New York-based pharmaceutical industry research firm , said 0 the government 's ruling was n't unexpected . 
`` This has become a very <unk> deal , concerning Canada 's only large , <unk> <unk> or pharmaceutical company , '' Mr. <unk> said *T* . 
Mr. <unk> said 0 the move that *T* could allow the transaction to go ahead as * planned * could be an <unk> settlement of <unk> 's dispute with the University of Toronto . 
The University is seeking * to block the acquisition of <unk> by foreign interests , * citing concerns about the amount of research that *T* would be done * in Canada . 
The university is considering a settlement proposal made * by <unk> . 
While neither side will disclose its <unk> , Mr. <unk> expects it to contain more specific guarantees on research and development spending levels in Canada than <unk> offered *?* to Investment Canada . 
Some analysts , such as Murray <unk> of Toronto-based Richardson <unk> Inc. , believe 0 the government ruling leaves the door open for other bidders , such as Switzerland 's Ciba-Geigy and <unk> Corp. of <unk> , <unk> . 
Officials for the two concerns , which *T* are bidding <unk> 30 *U* a share for <unk> , could n't be reached * for comment . 
French state-owned <unk> S.A. holds 51 % of <unk> . 
<unk> International Inc. said 0 it canceled plans for a <unk> swap but may resume payment of dividends on the stock , and added that it expects * to publicly offer about 10 million common shares . 
The company said 0 it planned * to offer an <unk> number of common shares in exchange for the <unk> shares of its preferred stock outstanding . 
The exchange ratio was never established * . 
<unk> said 0 market conditions led to the cancellation of the planned exchange . 
The <unk> concern said , however , that in January 1990 , it may resume payments of dividends on the preferred stock . 
<unk> suspended its <unk> payment in October 1985 and said 0 it has n't any plans * to catch up on dividends in <unk> about $ 6 million *U* , but will do so some time in the future . 
<unk> , the company said 0 it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the proposed offering of 10 million shares of common stock , expected * to be offered * in November . 
The company said 0 Salomon Brothers Inc. and Howard , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> Inc. , underwriters for the offering , were granted * an option * to buy as much as an additional 1.5 million shares * to cover <unk> . 
Proceeds will be used * * to eliminate and restructure bank debt . 
<unk> currently has approximately <unk> million common shares outstanding . 
Earnings for most of the nation 's major pharmaceutical makers are believed * to have moved ahead <unk> in the third quarter , as companies with newer , <unk> prescription drugs fared especially well . 
For the third consecutive quarter , however , most of the companies ' revenues were battered * by adverse <unk> <unk> as a result of the strong dollar abroad . 
Analysts said that Merck & Co. , Eli Lilly & Co. , Warner-Lambert Co. and the Squibb Corp. unit of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. all benefited from strong sales of relatively new , <unk> <unk> that *T* provide wide profit margins . 
Less robust earnings at Pfizer Inc. and Upjohn Co. were attributed * to those companies ' older products , many of which *T* face <unk> competition from generic drugs and other <unk> . 
Joseph <unk> , an analyst with Bear , Stearns & Co. , said that over the past few years most drug makers have shed their <unk> businesses and <unk> other cost savings , such as * consolidating manufacturing plants and administrative staffs . 
As a result , `` major new products are having significant impact , even on a company with very large revenues , '' Mr. <unk> said 0 *T* . 
Analysts said 0 profit for the dozen or so big drug makers , as a group , is estimated * to have climbed between 11 % and 14 % *U* . 
While that 's not spectacular , Neil <unk> , an analyst with Prudential <unk> , said that the rate of growth will `` look especially good as * compared * to other companies if the economy turns downward . '' 
Mr. <unk> estimated that Merck 's profit for the quarter rose by about 22 % , * <unk> * by sales of its <unk> of fast-growing prescription drugs , including its <unk> drug , <unk> ; a high blood pressure medicine , <unk> ; <unk> , an <unk> , and <unk> , an <unk> <unk> . 
Profit climbed even though Merck 's sales were reduced * by `` one to three percentage points '' as a result of the strong dollar , Mr. <unk> said 0 *T* . 
In the third quarter of 1988 , Merck earned $ <unk> million *U* , or 79 cents a share . 
In <unk> , N.J. , a Merck spokesman said 0 the company does n't make earnings projections . 
Mr. <unk> said 0 he estimated that Lilly 's earnings for the quarter jumped about 20 % , largely because of the performance of its new <unk> <unk> . 
The drug , introduced * last year , is expected * to generate sales of about $ 300 million *U* this year . 
`` It 's turning out * to be a real <unk> , '' Mr. <unk> said *T* . 
In last year 's third quarter , Lilly earned $ <unk> million *U* , or $ 1.20 *U* a share . 
In Indianapolis , Lilly declined comment . 
Several analysts said 0 they expected Warner-Lambert 's profit also to increase by more than 20 % from $ <unk> million *U* , or $ 1.25 *U* a share , 0 it reported *T* in the like period last year . 
The company is praised * by analysts for * sharply lowering its costs in recent years and <unk> numerous companies with low profit margins . 
The company 's lean operation , analysts said 0 *T* , allowed <unk> sales from its cholesterol drug , <unk> , to power earnings growth . 
<unk> sales are expected * to be about $ 300 million *U* this year , up from $ 190 million *U* in 1988 . 
In Morris Plains , N.J. , a spokesman for the company said 0 the analysts ' projections are `` in the <unk> . '' 
Squibb 's profit , * estimated by analysts * to be about 18 % above the $ <unk> million *U* , or $ 1.25 *U* a share , 0 it earned *T* in the third quarter of 1988 , was the result of especially strong sales of its <unk> drug for * treating high blood pressure and other heart disease . 
The company was officially merged * with Bristol-Myers Co. earlier this month . 
Bristol-Myers declined * to comment . 
Mr. <unk> of Bear Stearns said that <unk> Corp. 's expected profit rise of about 18 % to 20 % *U* , and <unk> 's expected profit increase of about 13 % are largely because `` those companies are really managed * well . '' 
<unk> earned $ <unk> million *U* , or 84 cents a share , while Bristol-Myers earned $ <unk> million *U* , or 81 cents a share , in the like period a year earlier . 
In Madison , N.J. , a spokesman for <unk> said 0 the company has `` no problems '' with the average estimate <unk> by a analysts that third-quarter earnings per share rose by about 19 % , to $ 1 *U* . 
The company expects * to achieve the 20 % increase in full-year earnings per share , as it projected in the spring , the spokesman said 0 *T* . 
Meanwhile , analysts said 0 Pfizer 's recent string of lackluster quarterly performances continued , as earnings in the quarter were expected * to decline by about 5 % . 
Sales of Pfizer 's important drugs , <unk> for * treating <unk> , and <unk> , a heart medicine , have shrunk because of increased competition . 
`` The -LRB- strong -RRB- dollar hurt Pfizer a lot , too , '' Mr. <unk> said *T* . 
In the third quarter last year , Pfizer earned $ <unk> million *U* , or $ <unk> *U* a share . 
In New York , the company declined comment . 
Analysts said 0 they expected Upjohn 's profit to be flat or rise by only about 2 % to 4 % *U* as * compared * with $ <unk> million *U* , or 49 cents a share , 0 it earned *T* a year ago . 
Upjohn 's <unk> drugs are <unk> , a <unk> , and <unk> , a <unk> . 
Sales of both drugs have been hurt * by new state laws restricting the <unk> of certain <unk> <unk> and adverse publicity about the excessive use of the drugs . 
Also , the company 's <unk> drug , <unk> , is selling well -- at about $ 125 million *U* for the year , but the company 's profit from the drug has been reduced * by Upjohn 's expensive print and television campaigns for advertising , analysts said 0 *T* . 
In <unk> , Mich. , Upjohn declined comment . 
Amid a crowd of <unk> stocks , <unk> Technology Inc. 's stock fell particularly hard Friday , * dropping 23 % because its problems were compounded * by disclosure of an unexpected loss for its fiscal first quarter . 
The <unk> software company said 0 it expects a $ 2 million *U* net loss for the fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 30 . 
It said 0 analysts had been expecting a small profit for the period . 
Revenue is expected * to be `` up modestly '' from the $ <unk> million *U* reported * a year ago . 
<unk> Technology reported net income of $ 1.5 million *U* , or 12 cents a share , in the year-earlier period . 
`` While our international operations showed strong growth , our domestic business was substantially below expectations , '' said *T* Paul <unk> , president and chief executive officer . 
A spokesman said 0 the company 's first quarter is historically soft , and 0 computer companies in general are experiencing slower sales . 
Mr. <unk> said 0 he accepted the resignation of Thomas Wilson , vice president of corporate sales , and that his marketing responsibilities have been <unk> * . 
The company said 0 Mr. Wilson 's resignation was n't related to the sales shortfall . 
<unk> Technology went public in May 1988 at $ 14 *U* a share . 
It fell $ <unk> *U* a share Friday , to $ 6.25 *U* , a new low , in over-the-counter trading . 
Its high for the past year was $ <unk> *U* a share . 
In the previous quarter , the company earned $ 4.5 million *U* , or 37 cents a share , on sales of $ <unk> million *U* . 
The <unk> has a wonderful <unk> garden , a great <unk> , its own <unk> Little Italy -LRB- on Arthur Avenue -RRB- and , of course , the <unk> . 
However , most people , * having been <unk> * to news <unk> of the <unk> South <unk> , look at the <unk> the way 0 Tom <unk> 's Sherman <unk> did *?* *T* in `` <unk> of the <unk> '' -- as a wrong turn into hell . 
But <unk> <unk> 's <unk> , her <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , is something else altogether . 
In a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , `` <unk> <unk> '' -LRB- <unk> , <unk> pages , $ <unk> *U* -RRB- , she remembers an exotic <unk> , <unk> * mainly by Jewish <unk> and the occasional Catholic -LRB- real <unk> like her <unk> friend , the <unk> <unk> , age five -RRB- . 
Ms. <unk> , a <unk> and <unk> , has a <unk> and dramatically <unk> sense of recall . 
She <unk> her `` <unk> of the <unk> , a place where the <unk> of <unk> are only relieved * by steep <unk> into <unk> '' into the `` <unk> <unk> , '' a world <unk> with sex and death and <unk> . 
In the <unk> <unk> , Jewish <unk> people lived in <unk> , <unk> buildings `` <unk> '' * with names like <unk> <unk> -LRB- after owners <unk> and Morris <unk> -RRB- , whose <unk> and <unk> *T* were <unk> * with <unk> of ancient <unk> and <unk> , <unk> of <unk> . 
For Ms. <unk> the <unk> <unk> matched the <unk> 0 she felt *T* * living in the <unk> <unk> as a little girl : `` <unk> <unk> ordinary , <unk> <unk> , <unk> all <unk> to <unk> <unk> . '' 
* <unk> and funny but never mean , she 's a <unk> a bit like <unk> <unk> , if he 'd been Jewish and female and less <unk> . 
Little <unk> , as Ms. <unk> calls herself *?* in the book , really was n't ordinary . 
She was raised * , for the first eight years , by her mother , <unk> , whom she remembers *T* as a <unk> <unk> , who *T* <unk> history * to explain why <unk> 's father did n't live with them *T* . 
<unk> <unk> this man , who *T* may <unk> or may not <unk> have known about his child , as a war hero for <unk> 's benefit . 
<unk> died * young and <unk> has remembered her as a <unk> figure , who *T* did n't interfere much with her child 's education on the streets . 
The games 0 <unk> children played *T* -LRB- * holding kids down and <unk> them , for example -RRB- seem <unk> by today 's crack standards , but Ms. <unk> makes it all sound like a great <unk> . 
`` Without official knowledge of sex or death , we <unk> with both , '' she writes *T* . 
She <unk> families by their <unk> arrangements . 
Her friend Susan , whose parents *T* kept <unk> her 0 she was unwanted , <unk> on a narrow bed <unk> * into her parents ' <unk> , as though she were a temporary visitor . 
Her friend <unk> 's father was a professional <unk> ; they did n't seem * to have any <unk> at all . 
Maybe <unk> became so <unk> with where people <unk> *T* and how because her own arrangements kept * shifting . 
When <unk> died *T* , her <unk> moved in -- and let her make the <unk> and other household arrangements . 
They painted the apartment * orange , <unk> and white , according to her instructions . 
With <unk> detail she recalls her <unk> <unk> , an <unk> <unk> and song <unk> -LRB- who *T* <unk> river with <unk> in a love song -RRB- ; and <unk> <unk> , a <unk> part-time investigator who *T* looked like Lincoln and carried a change of clothing in a Manila <unk> , * like an `` <unk> President on a <unk> mission . '' 
They came by their <unk> <unk> . 
<unk> 's <unk> , no <unk> <unk> , <unk> the heads of <unk> relatives from the family <unk> , and <unk> around her <unk> <unk> , `` <unk> for Women . '' 
The book loses some momentum toward the end , when <unk> becomes more <unk> with * <unk> boys and less with her <unk> <unk> family *T* . 
For the most part , though , there 's much pleasure in her <unk> , <unk> probe into the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> . 
The <unk> also figures in Bruce Jay Friedman 's latest novel , which *T* <unk> back to the New York of the <unk> . 
But both the past and present <unk> of `` The Current <unk> '' -LRB- Atlantic <unk> Press , 200 pages , $ <unk> *U* -RRB- feel <unk> and <unk> . 
For his sixth novel , Mr. Friedman tried * to <unk> the <unk> of his 1972 work , `` About Harry <unk> . '' 
Harry is now a <unk> writer , whose continuing <unk> with drugs and marginal types in Hollywood and New York *T* seems <unk> <unk> . 
Harry <unk> remembers the `` old '' days of the early <unk> , when people like his friend <unk> would take a <unk> on a date * to analyze what <unk> was doing *T* wrong *T* . 
`` An L.A. solution , '' explains *T* Mr. Friedman . 
Line by line Mr. Friedman 's <unk> <unk> can be <unk> , especially when he 's <unk> on the Hollywood social scheme -- the way 0 people size each other up , * immediately <unk> the desperate ones who *T* merely almost made it *T* *T* . 
Harry has avoided all that by * living in a Long Island suburb with his wife , who *T* 's so <unk> to soap <unk> and mystery <unk> 0 she barely seems * to notice when her husband <unk> for <unk> <unk> into Manhattan *T* . 
But it does n't take too many lines * to figure Harry out . 
He 's a <unk> . 
Gulf Resources & Chemical Corp. said 0 it agreed * to pay $ 1.5 million *U* as part of an accord with the Environmental Protection Agency regarding an environmental cleanup of a <unk> <unk> 0 the company formerly operated *T* in Idaho . 
In 1984 the EPA notified Gulf Resources , which *T* was a <unk> of the <unk> , that it was potentially liable for * sharing cleanup costs at the site under the federal <unk> program . 
The <unk> area is contaminated with lead , <unk> and other metals . 
Gulf Resources earlier this year proposed a reorganization plan that *T* would make it a unit of a <unk> concern , * potentially <unk> it from liability for the <unk> 's cleanup costs . 
The company said that as part of its agreement with the EPA , it `` made certain voluntary <unk> with respect to <unk> transactions entered into * after the reorganization . '' 
The company , which *T* issued a statement on the agreement late Friday , said that $ 1 million *U* of the payment was previously provided for * in its financial statements and that $ 500,000 *U* will be recognized * in its 1989 third-quarter statement . 
The agreement and consent decree are subject to court approval , the company said 0 *T* . 
Gulf Resources added that it `` will seek * to recover <unk> contribution from others for both the amount of the settlement and any other liabilities 0 it may <unk> *T* under the <unk> law . '' 
Under the agreement , Gulf must give the U.S. government 45 days ' advance written notice before * issuing any dividends on common stock . 
The company 's net worth can not fall below $ <unk> million *U* after the dividends are issued * . 
`` The terms of that agreement only become effective the date of Gulf 's reorganization , which we anticipate 0 *T* will occur sometime in early 1990 , '' said *T* Lawrence R. <unk> , Gulf 's general counsel . 
In addition , Gulf must give the government 20 days ' advance written notice of any loans exceeding $ 50 million *U* that *T* are made * to the <unk> holding company . 
Gulf 's net worth after those transaction must be at least $ 150 million *U* . 
Separately , the company said 0 it expects * to hold a special meeting for shareholders in early 1990 * to vote on its proposed reorganization . 
Many of the nation 's <unk> executives <unk> Friday 's market plunge as an overdue <unk> for speculators and takeover players . 
* <unk> that the market does n't head into a <unk> free fall , some executives think 0 Friday 's action could prove a <unk> of good news -- as a sign that the leveraged buy-out and takeover frenzy of recent years may be <unk> . 
`` This is a reaction to artificial LBO <unk> , rather than to any fundamentals , '' said *T* John Young , chairman of Hewlett-Packard Co. , whose shares *T* dropped $ <unk> *U* to $ <unk> *U* . 
`` If we get rid of a lot of that <unk> , it will be a big plus . '' 
A few of the executives here for the fall meeting of the Business Council , a group that *T* meets * to discuss national issues , were only too happy * to <unk> their criticism . 
`` People wish 0 the government would do something about leveraged buy-outs , do something about takeovers , do something about Donald Trump , '' said *T* <unk> <unk> , chairman of ITT Corp. , whose stock *T* dropped $ 3.375 *U* . 
`` Where 's *T* the leadership ? 
Where 's *T* the guy who *T* can say : 0 <unk> <unk> is enough ' '' ? 
The executives were remarkably <unk> by the plunge even though it <unk> billions of dollars off the value of their companies -- and millions off their personal fortunes . 
`` I 'm not going * to worry about one day 's decline , '' said *T* Kenneth <unk> , Digital Equipment Corp. president , who *T* was <unk> <unk> through the bright orange and yellow leaves of the mountains here after his company 's shares plunged $ <unk> *U* * to close at $ <unk> *U* . 
`` I did n't bother * calling anybody ; I did n't even turn on TV . '' 
`` There has n't been any fundamental change in the economy , '' added *T* John <unk> , whose Procter & Gamble Co. took an $ 8.75 *U* slide * to close at $ <unk> *U* . 
`` The fact that this happened two years ago and there was a recovery gives people some comfort that this <unk> n't be a problem . '' 
Of course , established corporate <unk> often tend * to <unk> the setbacks of stock speculators and takeover artists . 
Indeed , one chief executive who *T* was <unk> delighted by Friday 's events was Robert <unk> , chairman of AMR Corp. , the parent of American Airlines and the target of a takeover offer by Mr. Trump . 
* Asked * whether Friday 's action could help him avoid * being <unk> * by the New York real estate <unk> , Mr. <unk> <unk> broadly and said : `` No comment . '' 
On Friday morning , before the market 's sell-off , the business leaders issued a report predicting 0 the economy would grow at roughly an inflation-adjusted 2 % annual rate , through next year , then accelerate <unk> in 1991 . 
Of the 19 economists who *T* worked on the Business Council forecast , only two *T* projected periods of decline in the nation 's output over the next two years , and in `` both instances the declines are too modest * to warrant the phrase recession , '' said 0 *T* Lewis <unk> , chairman of J.P. Morgan & Co. and vice chairman of the Business Council . 
The real estate slump that *T* 's pushing down the price of New York office space and housing is also affecting the city 's retail real estate market . 
In Manhattan , <unk> store sites sit * vacant and newly <unk> space has been slow * to fill . 
Retail real estate brokers say 0 tenants are reluctant * to sign leases because of uncertainty about the local economy , turmoil in their own industries and a belief that rents have not yet hit bottom . 
`` There is an <unk> amount of space available , '' says *T* <unk> <unk> , senior vice president at <unk> Associates <unk> Leasing <unk> . 
There are about 2,000 stores for rent , up from a more typical range of 1,200 to 1,500 . 
`` This further <unk> retailers , '' she says *T* . 
`` They wonder should they sign a lease if prices are still coming down ? 
Is this the wrong time 0 * to open a store *T* ? 
Who *T* is going * to be in the space next door ? '' 
In addition , Ms. <unk> says 0 *T* , tenants usually can negotiate * to pay rents that *T* are about <unk> lower than <unk> ' initial asking price . 
A handful of hot retail locations , such as the <unk> Street and Madison and Fifth Avenue areas , have been able * to sustain what many see *T* as <unk> rents . 
And , in some neighborhoods , rents have merely hit a <unk> . 
But on average , Manhattan retail rents have dropped 10 % to 15 % in the past six months alone , experts say 0 *T* . 
That follows a more subtle decline in the prior six months , after Manhattan rents had run up rapidly since 1986 . 
The same factors limiting demand for office space have affected retailing . 
`` As businesses contract or <unk> , the number of employees who *T* might use retail services <unk> , '' says *T* Edward A. Friedman , senior vice president of <unk> <unk> <unk> . 
He says 0 financial problems <unk> electronics , <unk> and furniture companies -- key categories in the local retail economy -- have further <unk> the market . 
<unk> hit * are *T* what he calls *T* `` secondary '' sites that *T* primarily serve neighborhood residents . 
In these locations , Mr. Friedman says 0 *T* , `` <unk> are increasingly cautious about * expanding and rents have remained steady or in some cases have declined . '' 
<unk> in the restaurant industry , which *T* is leaving retail space vacant , <unk> the problem for <unk> . 
It <unk> is also no comfort to <unk> and small New York retailers when the future of larger department stores , which *T* <unk> retail neighborhoods , are in doubt *T* . 
Hooker Corp. , parent of <unk> <unk> and B. <unk> 's , is <unk> * in bankruptcy proceedings and Bloomingdale 's is for sale by its owner , Campeau <unk> . 
The trend toward lower rents may seem surprising given that some communities in New York are <unk> the loss of favorite local businesses to high rents . 
But , despite the recent softening , for many of these retailers there 's still been too big a jump from the rental rates of the late 1970s , when their leases were signed * *T* . 
Certainly , the recent drop in prices does n't mean 0 Manhattan comes cheap . 
New York retail rents still run well above the going rate in other U.S. cities . 
Madison and Fifth <unk> and East <unk> Street can command rents of up to $ 500 *U* a square foot , and $ 250 *U* is not <unk> . 
The <unk> <unk> Street area offers rents of about $ 100 *U* a square foot , as do <unk> locations along lower Fifth Avenue *?* . 
By contrast , <unk> in the best retail locations in Boston , San Francisco and Chicago rarely top $ 100 *U* a square foot . 
And rents on Beverly Hills ' <unk> <unk> generally do n't exceed about $ 125 *U* a square foot .

When Justice William Brennan marks the start of his <unk> year on the Supreme Court today *T* , the occasion will differ sharply from previous <unk> of his tenure . 
For the first time , the <unk> justice finds his influence almost exclusively in dissent , rather than as a force in the high court 's majority . 
This role reversal holds * true , as well , for his three liberal and moderate allies , <unk> <unk> Marshall , Harry <unk> and John Stevens . 
But are these four players , three of them in their <unk> , ready * to assume a different role after 88 years , <unk> , of service on the high court ? 
Every indication is that the four are prepared * to accept this new role , and the <unk> that *T* go with it , but in different ways . 
<unk> Brennan and Stevens appear <unk> about it ; <unk> Marshall and <unk> appear fighting <unk> . 
The four justices are no <unk> to dissent , * often joining forces in the past decade * to criticize the court 's conservative drift . 
But always , in years past , they have <unk> the trend and have been able * to pick up a fifth vote * to <unk> out a number of major victories in civil rights and <unk> cases . 
Now , however , as the court 's new <unk> conservative majority continues * to <unk> , victories for the liberals are rare . 
The change is most dramatic for Justice Brennan , the last <unk> of the <unk> liberal majority under Chief Justice Earl Warren . 
In the seven Supreme Court terms from the fall of 1962 through the spring of 1967 , the <unk> of the Warren Court 's power , Justice Brennan cast only 25 <unk> votes in <unk> cases decided * by the court . 
Last term alone he cast 52 <unk> votes in <unk> decisions , with the <unk> <unk> ruling as his only big victory . 
But Justice Brennan <unk> his new role , * strongly defending the importance of <unk> in a 1985 speech . 
`` Each time 0 the court <unk> an issue *T* , the justices will be forced by a dissent * to reconsider the fundamental questions and to <unk> the result , '' he said *T* . 
Moreover , in recent months he has said that when he was on the winning side in the 1960s *T* , he knew that the tables might turn in the future . 
He has said that he now knows how Justice John <unk> felt *T* , a reference to the late conservative justice who *T* was the most frequent <unk> from the Warren Court 's opinions . 
Associates of <unk> Justice Marshall say 0 he was `` depressed '' about the court 's direction last spring , but is <unk> about his role and determined * to speak out against the court 's cutbacks in civil rights . 
`` We could sweep it under the <unk> and hide it , but I 'm not going * to do it , '' he said *T* in a speech last month . 
He , * like Justice Brennan , considers <unk> highly important for the future , a point that *T* has n't escaped legal scholars . 
Harvard Law School <unk> Laurence <unk> says 0 there is a `` <unk> '' <unk> to current <unk> . 
The <unk> in the Warren Court , he says 0 *T* , appeared * to be writing for the short-term , * suggesting that the court 's direction might change soon . 
`` Brennan and Marshall are speaking in their <unk> to a more distant future , '' he says *T* . 
Justice <unk> , who *T* will turn 81 next month , also seems <unk> about his new role . 
Associates say 0 he takes some <unk> <unk> more personally than his colleagues , especially attempts * to curtail the right to abortion first recognized * in his 1973 opinion , <unk> vs. <unk> . 
<unk> and associates who *T* saw Justice <unk> during the summer said 0 he was no more discouraged about the court than in recent years . 
And his outlook improved after successful <unk> surgery in August . 
But his level of frustration showed in a recent , <unk> speech to a group of hundreds of lawyers in Chicago . 
He concluded his remarks by * <unk> , <unk> and at some length , according to those present , the late Martin <unk> King 's famous `` I <unk> a <unk> '' speech from the 1963 March on Washington . 
Justice Stevens , 69 , is probably the most <unk> of the <unk> about his role , in part because he may be the least liberal of the four , but also because he enjoys the intellectual challenge of * arguing with the majority more than the others . 
If the role 0 these four <unk> are assuming *T* is a familiar one in modern Supreme Court history , it also <unk> in an important way from recent history , court watchers say 0 *T* . 
`` The <unk> of the Warren Court were often defending a legal legacy that they inherited *T* , '' says 0 *T* Prof. <unk> Dick Howard of the University of Virginia Law School , `` but the <unk> today are defending a legacy that they created *T* . 
The government sold the deposits of four <unk> institutions , in its first wave of sales of big , sick thrifts , but low bids prevented the sale of a fifth . 
The four S&Ls were sold * to large banks , as * was the case with most of the 28 previous transactions initiated * by the <unk> Trust Corp. since it was created * in the S&L bailout legislation two months ago . 
Two of the four big thrifts were sold * to NCNB Corp. , Charlotte , N.C. , which *T* has aggressively expanded its markets , particularly in Texas and Florida . 
A Canadian bank bought another thrift , in the first <unk> transaction with a foreign bank . 
Under these deals , the <unk> sells just the deposits and the healthy assets . 
These `` <unk> '' transactions leave the bulk of bad assets , mostly real estate , with the government , * to be sold * later . 
In these four , for instance , the <unk> is stuck * with $ <unk> billion *U* in bad assets . 
<unk> paid premiums ranging from 1.5 % to 3.7 % <unk> for the deposits and branch systems , roughly in line with what analysts were expecting *T* . 
The buyers will also be locked * into deposit rates for just two weeks , as * has been the case with previous deals . 
After that , the buyers may <unk> the rates paid * by the former thrifts . 
But it <unk> 's uncertain whether these institutions will take those steps . 
NCNB , for example , has been one of the highest rate <unk> in the Texas market , and in Florida , rates are especially sensitive in retirement communities . 
The <unk> had previously targeted five thrifts for quick sales in order * to spend cash by certain <unk> <unk> , but the delays <unk> the tough <unk> facing the agency . 
`` These thrifts are <unk> <unk> , '' said *T* <unk> <unk> , an industry consultant based * in <unk> , <unk> . 
For example , the delay in * selling People 's Heritage Savings , <unk> , Kan. , with $ 1.7 billion *U* in assets , has forced the <unk> to consider selling off the thrift <unk> , instead of as a whole institution . 
NCNB continued its <unk> into the Florida and Texas markets . 
NCNB will acquire University Federal Savings Association , Houston , which *T* had assets of $ 2.8 billion *U* . 
NCNB Texas National Bank will pay the <unk> a premium of $ <unk> million *U* for $ 3.5 billion *U* in deposits . 
As a measure of the <unk> to which the Texas real estate market has <unk> *T* , the <unk> will pay $ 3.8 billion *U* to NCNB * to take $ 750 million *U* of bad assets . 
NCNB also acquired Freedom Savings & Loan Association , Tampa , Fla. , which *T* had total assets of $ 900 million *U* . 
NCNB will pay the <unk> a premium of $ <unk> million *U* for $ 1.1 billion *U* in deposits . 
NCNB will also acquire $ <unk> million *U* of Freedom 's assets from the <unk> , which *T* will require $ <unk> million *U* in assistance . 
<unk> Bancorp Inc. , <unk> , Pa. , will acquire Hill Financial Savings Association , Red Hill , Pa. , which *T* had $ 2.3 billion *U* in assets . 
<unk> will pay a premium of $ <unk> million *U* * to assume $ 2 billion *U* in deposits . 
It will also purchase $ <unk> million *U* of the thrift 's assets , with $ 1.9 billion *U* in <unk> assistance . 
In the first <unk> transaction with a foreign buyer , Royal <unk> Ltd. , Toronto , will acquire Pacific Savings Bank , Costa Mesa , Calif. , which *T* had $ <unk> million *U* in assets . 
Royal <unk> will pay the <unk> $ 25 million *U* * to assume $ <unk> million *U* in deposits . 
It will also purchase $ <unk> million *U* in assets , and receive $ 550 million *U* in assistance from the <unk> . 
The following issues were recently filed * with the Securities and Exchange Commission :

Time magazine , in a move 0 *T* to reduce the costs of * <unk> new subscribers , is lowering its circulation guarantee to advertisers for the second consecutive year , increasing its <unk> rates and cutting back on merchandise <unk> . 
In an announcement to its staff last week , executives at Time Warner Inc. 's weekly magazine said 0 Time will `` dramatically <unk> '' its use of electronic <unk> such as telephones in television <unk> drives ; cut the circulation 0 it guarantees advertisers *T* by 300,000 , to four million ; and increase the cost of its annual <unk> rate by about $ 4 *U* to $ 55 *U* . 
In a related development , the <unk> , for the fourth year in a row , said 0 it <unk> n't increase its advertising rates in 1990 ; a full , <unk> page in the magazine costs about $ <unk> *U* . 
However , because the guaranteed circulation base is being lowered * , ad rates will be effectively 7.5 % <unk> higher per <unk> , according to Richard <unk> , Time associate publisher . 
Time is following the course of some other <unk> magazines that *T* in recent years have challenged the publishing <unk> that * maintaining artificially high , and expensive , <unk> is the way 0 * to draw advertisers *T* . 
In recent years , <unk> 's <unk> , New York Times Co. 's <unk> 's , and most recently News Corp. 's TV Guide , have cut their massive circulation rate bases * to eliminate marginal circulation and hold down rates for advertisers . 
<unk> discounts in <unk> and offers of free clock <unk> and watches have become accepted forms of * attracting new subscribers in the <unk> world of magazine <unk> . 
But Time , as part of the more <unk> Time Warner , wants * to <unk> itself away from expensive <unk> . 
Besides , Time executives think 0 * selling a news magazine with a clock radio is <unk> . 
`` <unk> just give people the wrong image , '' said 0 *T* Mr. <unk> . 
`` That perception takes the focus off the magazine . '' 
Time magazine executives <unk> paint the circulation cut as a show of strength and actually a benefit to advertisers . 
`` What we are doing *T* is * screening out the readers who *T* are only <unk> related to the magazine and do n't really read it , '' said *T* Mr. <unk> . 
`` We are trying * to create quality and involvement . '' 
However , Time executives used the same explanation when in October 1988 the magazine cut its guaranteed circulation from 4.6 million to 4.3 million *T* . 
And Time 's paid circulation , according to <unk> Bureau of <unk> , dropped 7.3 % to <unk> in the six months ended June 30 , 1989 . 
Still , Time 's move is being received * well , once again . 
`` It <unk> 's <unk> for advertisers to know 0 the reader will be paying more , '' said 0 *T* Michael <unk> , national media director at <unk> Inc. ad agency . 
`` A few drops in circulation are of no consequence . 
It 's not a show of weakness ; they are improving the quality of circulation while * <unk> their profits . '' 
Mr. <unk> said 0 the changes represent a new focus in the magazine industry : a magazine 's net revenue per <unk> , or the actual revenue from subscribers after discounts and the cost of premiums have been stripped * away . 
`` The question is how much are we getting *T* from each reader , '' said *T* Mr. <unk> . 
Time 's rivals <unk> , Washington Post Co. 's <unk> and U.S. News & World Report , are less <unk> on electronic <unk> , and in recent years both have been increasing their circulation rate bases . 
Both magazines are expected * to announce their ad rates and circulation levels for 1990 within a month . 
When the news <unk> broke of an attempted coup in Panama two weeks ago *T* , Sen. Christopher <unk> called the State Department for a briefing . 
`` They said , <unk> * follow <unk> , ' '' he told reporters *T* . 
That shows how far Ted Turner 's Cable News Network has come *T* since its birth nine years ago , when it was considered * the <unk> of television news . 
It is bigger , faster and more profitable than the news divisions of any of the three major broadcast networks . 
Its niche as the `` network of record '' during major <unk> draws elite audiences around the world . 
But for all its success , <unk> has hit a <unk> . 
Although <unk> <unk> when big news breaks *T* , it <unk> during periods of calm . 
<unk> executives worry that the network 's <unk> but <unk> news format may be getting <unk> and <unk> n't keep viewers coming back as the alternatives <unk> <unk> for news and information on cable-TV . 
`` Just the fact 0 we 're on 24 hours is no longer <unk> , '' says *T* Ed Turner , <unk> 's executive vice president , news gathering -LRB- and no relation to Ted Turner -RRB- . 
`` You <unk> n't live on that . '' 
So <unk> , a unit of Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting System Inc. , is trying * to <unk> itself as a primary channel , or what people in the television industry call *T* a `` top of mind '' network . 
<unk> , * to kick off the effort , <unk> will <unk> its first prime-time <unk> in years , an <unk> show at 6 <unk> . Eastern time 0 *T* to air <unk> against the network <unk> . 
The show will be <unk> * by Bernard Shaw and <unk> <unk> , a <unk> former Texas judge and campus beauty <unk> who *T* has never held a job in television or journalism . 
The new show is perhaps the <unk> in a number of steps 0 the network is taking *T* * to build audience loyalty by * shifting away from its current format toward more <unk> `` <unk> '' programming with <unk> stars . 
* To <unk> itself , <unk> is also expanding international coverage and adding a second <unk> program . 
It is paying higher salaries -- after years of <unk> -- * to lure and keep experienced staffers . 
And it is <unk> on an expensive gamble * to break major stories with a large <unk> team . 
`` The next stage is * to get beyond the opinion leaders who *T* use us as a point of reference * to become a point of reference at ordinary dinner tables , '' says *T* Jon <unk> , executive vice president of <unk> News , <unk> 's sister network . 
But that <unk> n't be easy . 
<unk> , like other consumer products , develop images in <unk> ' minds that *T* are n't easy 0 * to change *T* . 
It also takes money that <unk> has been reluctant * to spend *T* * to make programs and hire talent that viewers will tune in <unk> * to see *T* . 
And the cable-TV operators -- <unk> 's distributors and part owners -- like things just the way 0 they are *T* . 
The <unk> bid is aimed * at <unk> 's <unk> <unk> -- and what *T* may happen to it as the cable-TV news market grows more competitive . 
Already , <unk> is facing stronger competition from Financial News Network Inc. and General Electric Co. 's Consumer News and Business Channel , both of which *T* are likely * to pursue more general news in the future . 
In addition , many cable-TV systems themselves are <unk> more local and regional news programs produced * by local broadcast stations . 
<unk> wants * to change its viewers ' habits . 
Its watchers are , on the whole , a <unk> group of <unk> `` <unk> '' and news <unk> , who *T* spend an average of just 26 minutes a day * watching <unk> , according to audience research . 
That 's less than one-third the time that viewers watch the major broadcast networks *T* . 
The brief attention 0 viewers give <unk> *T* could put it at a disadvantage as ratings data , and advertising , become more important to cable-TV channels . 
<unk> 's <unk> habits have been <unk> * by its format . 
Its strategy in the past has been * to serve as a TV wire service . 
It focused on * building up its news <unk> around the world , so as events took place it could go live <unk> and longer than other networks . 
It filled its daily schedule with <unk> called * `` <unk> , '' `` <unk> , '' `` <unk> , '' and `` <unk> , '' but the shows varied little in content , personality or look . 
Now , the push <unk> is on for <unk> shows . 
`` Our goal is * to create more programs with an individual identity , '' says *T* Paul <unk> , <unk> executive vice president for programming . 
<unk> , <unk> is adding a <unk> show in the morning because surveys show 0 its <unk> hour in the afternoon is among its most `` <unk> '' programs in viewers ' minds , says 0 *T* Mr. <unk> . 
And it is exploring other original programs , similar to its `` Larry King <unk> '' and `` <unk> '' talk shows , which executives hope 0 *T* will keep people <unk> * in . 
Then there 's `` The World Today , '' the prime-time <unk> featuring Mr. Shaw and Ms. <unk> . 
Until now , <unk> has featured its Hollywood <unk> show during the key evening period . 
But 70 % of the <unk> households that *T* watch news do so between <unk> p.m. and 7 p.m. , the network discovered 0 *T* , so <unk> wants in . 
Mr. <unk> says 0 the <unk> team will probably do two live interviews a day , with most of the program , at least for now , appearing similar to <unk> 's other <unk> . 
Some in the industry are skeptical . 
`` I find it <unk> hard * to <unk> of people switching over to <unk> for what , at least in the public 's mind , *T* is the same news , '' says *T* <unk> Frank , the former <unk> president of NBC News and <unk> of the <unk> Report . 
The evening news is also slated * as <unk> 's stage for its big push into investigative journalism . 
In August , the network hired <unk> producer <unk> Hill , the former head of news <unk> at ABC . 
She 's <unk> a staff of about 35 investigative reporters who *T* will produce weekly , <unk> segments , with an eye toward * breaking big stories . 
<unk> executives hope 0 the headlines created * by such <unk> will generate excitement for its `` <unk> '' programs , in the way 0 `` 60 <unk> '' did so well for CBS *T* . 
That 's such a departure from the past that many in the industry are skeptical 0 <unk> will follow through with its investigative commitment , especially after it sees the cost of * producing <unk> pieces . 
`` They 've never shown any <unk> * to spend money on production , '' says *T* Michael <unk> , a senior producer with <unk> <unk> , who *T* notes that <unk> is <unk> to his job . 
The network 's salaries have always ranged far below industry standards , * resulting in a <unk> work force . 
<unk> recently gave most employees raises of as much as 15 % , but they 're still drastically <unk> * compared with the networks . 
Says <unk> Mr. <unk> : `` <unk> is my wire service ; they 're on top of everything . 
But * to improve , they 've really got * to make the investment in people . '' 
In any case , <unk> operators have reason 0 * to fear any <unk> with <unk> 's format *T* . 
They market cable-TV on the very <unk> opportunities 0 <unk> seeks * to discourage *T* . 
`` We would obviously be upset if those kinds of services <unk> into more <unk> , <unk> programming , '' says *T* Robert <unk> , senior vice president , programming , of Continental <unk> Inc. , which *T* holds a 2 % stake in Turner Broadcasting . 
The Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals opinion in the <unk> <unk> case did not <unk> the position 0 Pennzoil Co. took *T* in its dispute with Texaco , contrary to your Sept. 8 article `` Court <unk> Texaco 's <unk> in Pennzoil Case -- Too Late . '' 
The fundamental rule of contract law applied * to both cases was that courts will not enforce agreements to which the parties did not intend * to be bound * *T* . 
In the <unk> litigation , the courts found 0 Pennzoil and Getty Oil intended * to be bound * ; in <unk> <unk> they found 0 there was no intention * to be bound * . 
<unk> , the principle in the cases is the same . 
But the outcome of a legal dispute almost always turns on the facts . 
And the facts , as * found * by the various courts in these two lawsuits , were different . 
When you suggest otherwise *T* , you leave the <unk> of reporting and enter the <unk> of speculation .

Valley Federal Savings & Loan Association said 0 Imperial Corp. of America withdrew from regulators its application * to buy five Valley Federal branches , * leaving the transaction in <unk> . 
The broken purchase appears as additional evidence of trouble at Imperial Corp. , whose spokesman *T* said 0 the company withdrew its application from the federal Office of <unk> <unk> because of an informal notice that Imperial 's thrift unit failed * to meet Community <unk> Act requirements . 
The Community <unk> Act requires savings and loan associations to lend money in amounts related to areas where deposits are received * *T* . 
The transaction , * announced * in August , included about $ <unk> million *U* in deposits at the five outlets in California 's San <unk> Valley . 
Terms were n't disclosed * , but Valley Federal had said 0 it expected * to post a modest pretax gain and to save about $ 2 million *U* in operating costs annually . 
Valley Federal said Friday that it is considering whether * to seek another buyer for the branches or to pursue the transaction with Imperial Corp. , which *T* said 0 it is attempting * to meet Community <unk> Act requirements . 
Valley Federal , with assets of $ 3.3 billion *U* , is based * in Van <unk> .

Lawyers for dozens of insolvent savings and loan associations are trying a new <unk> in their efforts * to <unk> suits filed * by borrowers , developers and creditors . 
The thrifts ' lawyers claim that the suits , <unk> 700 to 1,000 in Texas alone , should be dismissed * as <unk> because neither the S&Ls nor the <unk> Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. has the money 0 * to pay judgments *T* . 
Though the argument may have a <unk> ring to it , even the S&L lawyers concede 0 there 's little precedent 0 *T* to back their position . 
Still , one federal appeals court has signaled 0 it 's willing * to <unk> the notion , and the lawyers have renewed their arguments in Texas and eight other states where the defense is permitted * under state law *T* . 
The dismissal of the pending suits could go a long way toward * clearing court <unk> in Texas and reducing the FSLIC 's massive legal bills , which *T* topped $ 73 million *U* last year .

`` If true , '' the court wrote *T* , `` this contention would justify dismissal of these actions on <unk> grounds . '' 
But the court said 0 it lacked enough financial information about <unk> and the FSLIC and sent the cases back to federal district court in Dallas . 
Charles <unk> , a lawyer for <unk> , says 0 he plans * to file a brief <unk> this week urging the district judge * to dismiss the suits , because <unk> 's liabilities exceeded its assets by about $ 2 billion *U* when federal regulators closed it in August 1988 *T* .

The decision is the latest move in an escalating battle between the franchisees and Mr. Posner that *T* began in August . 
At the time , a group called * <unk> Partners Ltd. , consisting of eight of <unk> 's largest franchisees , offered more than $ 200 million *U* * to buy <unk> 's Inc. , which *T* is part of <unk> <unk> .

September 's steep rise in producer prices shows that inflation still <unk> , and the <unk> over interest rates caused * by the new price data contributed to the stock market 's plunge Friday . 
After * falling for three consecutive months , the producer price index for finished goods shot up 0.9 % last month , the Labor Department reported 0 *T* Friday , as energy prices jumped after * <unk> through the summer . 
Although the report , which *T* was released * before the stock market opened , did n't trigger the <unk> drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , analysts said 0 it did play a role in the market 's decline . 
Analysts immediately viewed the price data , the <unk> inflation news in months , as evidence that the Federal Reserve was unlikely * to allow interest rates to fall as many investors had hoped 0 *?* . 
* Further <unk> the belief that pressures in the economy were sufficient * to keep the Fed from * easing credit , the Commerce Department reported Friday that retail sales grew 0.5 % in September , to $ <unk> billion *U* . 
That rise came on top of a 0.7 % gain in August , and suggested 0 there is still healthy consumer demand in the economy . 
`` I think 0 the Friday report , combined with the actions of the Fed , weakened the belief that there was going * to be an imminent easing of monetary policy , '' said *T* Robert <unk> , chief economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago . 
But economists were divided over the extent of the inflation threat signaled * by the new numbers . 
`` The overall 0.9 % increase is serious in itself , but what *T* is even worse is that excluding food and energy , the producer price index still increased by 0.7 % , '' said *T* Gordon <unk> , an economist at the National Association of Manufacturers . 
But <unk> <unk> <unk> , chief economist at <unk> Corp. in Minneapolis , blamed rising energy prices and the annual autumn increase in car prices for most of the September jump . 
`` I would say 0 this is not bad news ; this is a <unk> , '' he said *T* . 
`` The core rate is not really out of line . '' 
All year , energy prices have <unk> the producer price index , which *T* measures changes in the prices 0 producers receive *T* for goods . 
Inflation <unk> has fallen back from its <unk> pace last winter , when a steep run-up in world oil prices sent the index surging at double-digit annual rates *T* . 
Energy prices then plummeted through the summer , * causing the index to decline for three consecutive months . 
Overall , the index has climbed at a 5.1 % compound annual rate since the start of the year , the Labor Department said 0 *T* . 
While * far more restrained than the pace at the beginning of the year , that is still a <unk> rise than the <unk> % increase for all of 1988 . 
Moreover , this year 's good inflation news may have ended last month , when energy prices <unk> up 6.5 % after * plunging 7.3 % in August *T* . 
Some analysts expect oil prices to remain relatively stable in the months ahead , * leaving the future pace of inflation uncertain . 
Analysts had expected that the climb in oil prices last month would lead to a substantial rise in the producer price index , but the 0.9 % climb was higher than most anticipated 0 *?* . 
`` I think 0 the resurgence -LCB- in inflation -RCB- is going * to continue for a few months , '' said *T* John <unk> , chief economist at Bell <unk> Cannon , a Washington economic forecasting firm . 
He predicted 0 that inflation will moderate next year , * saying that credit conditions are fairly tight world-wide . 
But <unk> Van <unk> , president of the National Association of <unk> , said that last month 's rise `` is n't as bad an <unk> '' as the 0.9 % figure suggests 0 *?* . 
`` If you examine the data carefully , the increase is concentrated * in energy and motor vehicle prices , rather than * being a <unk> advance in the prices of consumer and industrial goods , '' he explained *T* . 
<unk> car prices jumped 3.8 % in September , after * climbing 0.5 % in August and declining in the late spring and summer . 
Many analysts said 0 the September increase was a one-time event , * coming as dealers introduced their 1990 models . 
Although all the price data were adjusted * for normal seasonal fluctuations , car prices rose beyond the <unk> autumn increase . 
Prices for capital equipment rose a hefty 1.1 % in September , while prices for home electronic equipment fell 1.1 % . 
Food prices declined 0.6 % , after * climbing 0.3 % in August . 
Meanwhile , the retail sales report showed that car sales rose 0.8 % in September to $ <unk> billion *U* . 
But at least part of the increase could have come from higher prices , analysts said 0 *T* . 
Sales at general merchandise stores rose 1.7 % after * declining 0.6 % in August , while sales of building materials fell 1.8 % after * rising 1.7 % . 
<unk> prices for intermediate goods grew 0.4 % in September , after * dropping for three consecutive months . 
Prices for crude goods , an array of raw materials , jumped 1.1 % after * declining 1.9 % in August and <unk> up 0.2 % in July . 
Here are *T* the Labor Department 's producer price indexes -LRB- 1982 <unk> 100 -RRB- for September , before seasonal adjustment , and the percentage changes from September , 1988 . 
<unk> Financial Corp. said 0 it expects * to report a loss of at least $ 125 million to $ 150 million *U* for the third quarter . 
In the year-earlier period , <unk> had net income of $ <unk> *U* , but no per-share earnings . 
<unk> 's president and chief executive officer , John <unk> , said 0 the loss stems from several factors . 
He said 0 nonperforming assets rose to slightly more than $ 700 million *U* from $ <unk> million *U* between June and September . 
<unk> 85 % of the total consisted of nonperforming commercial real estate assets . 
<unk> , <unk> estimated that it will provide between $ 85 million and $ 110 million *U* for credit losses in the third quarter . 
<unk> added that significant additional loan-loss provisions may be required * by federal regulators as part of the current annual examination of City Federal Savings Bank , <unk> 's primary subsidiary , based * in <unk> , <unk> . 
City Federal operates 105 banking offices in New Jersey and Florida . 
Mr. <unk> said 0 <unk> will also mark its portfolio of high-yield corporate bonds to market as a result of federal legislation requiring that savings institutions <unk> themselves of such bonds . 
That action , <unk> said 0 *T* , will result in a charge against third-quarter results of approximately $ 30 million *U* . 
<unk> also said 0 it expects * to shed its remaining mortgage loan <unk> operations outside its principal markets in New Jersey and Florida and , as a result , is taking a charge for discontinued operations . 
All these actions , Mr. <unk> said 0 *T* , will result in a loss of $ 125 million *U* to $ 150 million *U* for the third quarter . 
He added , however : 0 `` <unk> on the resolution of certain accounting issues relating to mortgages servicing and the outcome of the annual examination of City Federal currently in progress with respect to the appropriate level of loan loss reserves , the total loss for the quarter could significantly exceed this range . 
<unk> Savings Bank said 0 federal thrift regulators ordered it * to suspend dividend payments on its two classes of preferred stock , * indicating that regulators ' concerns about the troubled institution have heightened . 
In a statement , Miami-based <unk> said 0 the regulators cited the thrift 's operating losses and `` apparent losses '' in its junk-bond portfolio in * ordering the suspension of the dividends . 
<unk> also ordered <unk> * to stop * buying back the preferred stock . 
David L. Paul , chairman and chief executive officer , criticized the federal Office of <unk> <unk> , which *T* issued the <unk> , * saying 0 it was `` inappropriate '' and based on `` insufficient '' reasons . 
He said 0 the thrift will try * to get regulators to reverse the decision . 
The suspension of a preferred stock dividend is a serious step that *T* signals that regulators have deep concerns about an institution 's health . 
In March , regulators labeled <unk> a `` troubled institution , '' largely because of its big junk-bond holdings and its operating losses . 
In the same month , the Office of <unk> <unk> ordered the institution * to stop * paying common stock dividends until its operations were on track . 
For the nine months ended June 30 , <unk> had a net loss of $ <unk> million *U* , compared with year-earlier net income of $ <unk> million *U* . 
<unk> , which *T* is Florida 's largest thrift , holds one of the largest junk-bond portfolios of any thrift in the nation . 
Since April , it has <unk> its high-yield bond holdings to about $ <unk> million *U* from $ 1.35 billion *U* . 
Mr. Paul said 0 only about $ 150 million *U* of the current holdings are <unk> securities registered * with the Securities and Exchange Commission . 
The remainder , he said 0 *T* , are commercial loan <unk> , or private <unk> , that *T* are n't filed * with the SEC and do n't have a ready market . 
<unk> and regulators have been in a dispute over market <unk> for the junk bonds . 
The Office of <unk> <unk> has been <unk> <unk> * to provide current market values for its holdings , but <unk> has said 0 it <unk> n't easily obtain such values because of the relative <unk> of the bonds and lack of a ready market . 
<unk> have become increasingly <unk> about <unk> 's and other thrifts ' junk-bond holdings in light of the recent federal thrift bailout legislation and the recent deep decline in the junk-bond market . 
The legislation requires thrifts to <unk> themselves of junk bonds in the new , <unk> regulatory climate . 
In American Stock Exchange composite trading Friday , <unk> common shares closed at $ 3 *U* , down 12.5 cents . 
In a statement Friday , Mr. Paul challenged the regulators ' decision , * saying 0 the thrift 's operating losses and `` apparent '' junk-bond losses `` have been substantially offset * by gains in other activities of the bank . '' 
He also said 0 substantial reserves have been set * aside for possible losses from the junk bonds . 
In the third quarter , for instance , <unk> added $ 22.5 million *U* to its general reserves . 
Mr. Paul said 0 the regulators should instead move ahead with * approving <unk> 's request * to sell 63 of its 71 branches to Great Western Bank , a unit of Great Western Financial Corp. based * in Beverly Hills , <unk> . 
The branch sale is the <unk> of <unk> 's strategy * to <unk> itself into a traditional S&L from a <unk> institution that *T* relied heavily on securities trading for profits , according to Mr. Paul . 
Most analysts and thrift executives had expected a decision on the proposed transaction , which *T* was announced * in July , long before now . 
Many <unk> the delay as an indication that regulators are skeptical about the proposal . 
<unk> and deposits can be sold * at a premium in the event 0 federal regulators take over an institution . 
<unk> , however , <unk> the branch sale , * saying 0 it would bring in $ 150 million *U* and reduce the thrift 's assets to $ 6.7 billion *U* from $ 9 billion *U* . 
It said 0 the sale would give it positive tangible capital of $ 82 million *U* , or about 1.2 % of assets , from a negative $ 33 million *U* as of Sept. 30 , thus * bringing <unk> close to regulatory standards . 
<unk> said 0 the branch sale would also reduce the company 's large amount of good will by about $ 180 million *U* . 
Critics , however , say 0 the branch sale will make <unk> more dependent than ever on <unk> deposits and junk bonds . 
Mr. Paul counters that he intends * to further <unk> the size of <unk> by * not <unk> more than $ 1 billion *U* of <unk> certificates of deposit when they come due *T* . 
The thrift is also working * to <unk> its junk-bond portfolio by * continuing * to sell off the bonds , and it plans * to eventually place some of them in a separate affiliate , as * required * under the new thrift law . 
On a recent Saturday night , in the midst of West Germany 's most popular prime-time show , a <unk> bet the host that she could name any of 100 different <unk> after just one <unk> , while * <unk> * . 
The woman won the bet . 
But perhaps * even more remarkable , the <unk> , `` <unk> <unk> '' -LRB- * <unk> a <unk> -RRB- , regularly wins the top <unk> in the country 's TV ratings , * sometimes drawing as many as 50 % of West German households . 
As the 1992 economic integration approaches , Europe 's cultural <unk> have taken to the <unk> against American `` cultural <unk> , '' * threatening * to impose quotas against such pop <unk> as `` Dallas , '' `` Miami Vice '' and `` L.A. Law . '' 
But much of what the Europeans want * to protect *T* seems every bit as <unk> as what they are trying * to keep *T* out . 
The most <unk> opposition to American TV imports has come from French television and movie producers , who *T* have demanded quotas ensuring that a full 60 % of Europe 's TV shows be produced * in Europe . 
So far , the French have failed * to win enough <unk> support * to prevail . 
A <unk> through the television listings and a few <unk> of the European television <unk> suggest one reason why . 
While there are some popular action and drama series , few <unk> the high culture and <unk> production values 0 one might expect *T* . 
More European air time is filled * with <unk> game shows , variety hours , movies and talk shows , many of which *T* are authorized <unk> of their American counterparts . 
One of France 's most popular Saturday night programs features <unk> seeking out their <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> . 
A <unk> game show has as its host a Belgian <unk> * to be Italian . 
One of Italy 's favorite shows , `` <unk> , '' a <unk> variety show , is so popular that viewers <unk> * to buy a <unk> product , `` <unk> <unk> , '' whose <unk> *T* were <unk> * each week by dancing <unk> -- even though the product did n't exist . 
* <unk> the <unk> <unk> , on another typical evening of fun on `` <unk> <unk> , '' a <unk> won a bet <unk> with the show 's host , Thomas <unk> , that he could identify 300 German <unk> over the telephone . 
A celebrity guest , U.S. <unk> to West Germany Richard <unk> , also won a bet that someone could <unk> up $ 150 *U* worth of quarters on a <unk> coin . 
Mr. <unk> nonetheless paid the penalty as if he had lost , * agreeing * to spend a day with West German Foreign Minister <unk> <unk> * <unk> and selling their combined weight in <unk> <unk> . 
If this seems like pretty weak stuff around which * to raise the protectionist barriers *T* , it may be because these shows need all the protection 0 they can get *T* . 
European programs usually target only their own local audience , and often only a small portion of that . 
<unk> in Germany or Italy rarely make it even to France or Great Britain , and almost never show up on U.S. screens . 
<unk> * to produce `` <unk> '' programs have generally resulted in disappointment . 
One annual <unk> , the <unk> `` <unk> <unk> <unk> , '' featuring <unk> songs from each of 20 European countries , has been described * as the world 's most <unk> TV show . 
Another , `` <unk> <unk> <unk> , '' where <unk> from <unk> European countries make <unk> of themselves * performing <unk> tasks *T* , is a hit in France . 
A <unk> <unk> under the title `` Almost <unk> <unk> '' <unk> fast . 
For the most part , what *T* 's made * here stays here , and for good reason . 
The cream of the British crop , the literary <unk> that *T* are shown * on U.S. public television as `` <unk> Theater , '' make up a relatively small part of British air time . 
Most British programming is more of an acquired taste . 
There is , for instance , `` One Man and His <unk> , '' a <unk> contest among <unk> dogs . 
Also <unk> to the British are *T* hours of <unk> <unk> , even more hours of lawn <unk> contests and still more hours of <unk> <unk> . 
European drama has had better , though still mixed , fortunes . 
The most popular such shows focus on narrow national concerns . 
A French <unk> of `` Dallas , '' called * `` <unk> '' and set * in a French <unk> , had a good run in France , which *T* ended after the female lead was injured * in a <unk> auto accident . 
`` <unk> , '' -LRB- Black Forest <unk> -RRB- , a kind of German `` <unk> . Elsewhere '' set * in a health <unk> , is popular in Germany , and has spread into France . 
Italy 's most popular series is a drama called * `` La <unk> , '' or `` The <unk> , '' which *T* <unk> the fight of an <unk> young investigator in <unk> against the <unk> . 
It was front-page news in Italy earlier this year when the <unk> inspector was <unk> * down in the series *T* . 
Spain 's most popular <unk> this year was `` <unk> , '' the story of an aging <unk> . 
`` The trend is pretty well established * now that local programs are the most popular , with American programs second , '' says *T* Brian <unk> , a former director of programs for the British Broadcasting <unk> . 
`` Given a choice , everybody will watch a <unk> show . '' 
But frequently there is n't much choice . 
Thus , Europe has begun the recent <unk> 0 *T* to produce more <unk> shows of its own , programs with broader appeal . 
`` We 've basically got * to start from <unk> , to train writers and producers * to make shows that other people will want * to see *T* , '' concedes *T* <unk> Young , head of Britain 's National Film <unk> School . 
While some in the U.S. contend that advertising is the <unk> of television , here many believe that its absence is * to blame * for the European TV industry 's sluggish development . 
Until recently , national governments in Europe controlled most of the air time and allowed little or no advertising . 
Since production costs were guaranteed * , it <unk> did n't matter that a program could n't be sold * abroad or put * into syndication , as most American programs are *?* * . 
But not much money was spent * on the shows , either , a situation that *T* encouraged <unk> talk and game shows , while * <unk> <unk> <unk> . 
Now , however , commercial channels are coming to most European countries , and at the same time , satellite and cable technology is spreading rapidly . 
Just last week , Greece authorized two commercial channels for the first time ; Spain earlier began * to allow commercial television alongside its state channels . 
The result is a new and huge appetite for programming . 
But perhaps to the <unk> of those calling for quotas , most of this <unk> is likely * to be filled * with the <unk> and most <unk> programming now available -- <unk> -- usually of shows made * in the U.S. . 
<unk> Channel , a <unk> venture of <unk> press <unk> Rupert Murdoch , offers what *T* must be a <unk> cultural mix to most of its audience . 
The financially struggling station offers programs obviously made * available <unk> from its boss 's other ventures . 
In a Madrid hotel room recently , a <unk> caught the end of a badly acted series about a fishing boat on Australia 's Great <unk> <unk> , * only to be urged * by the British <unk> * to `` stay * <unk> * for the further <unk> of <unk> the <unk> . ''

British Aerospace PLC and France 's <unk> S.A. said 0 they are <unk> an agreement * to merge their <unk> divisions , * greatly expanding <unk> between the two defense contractors . 
The 50-50 joint venture , which *T* may be dubbed * <unk> , would have combined annual sales of at least # 1.4 billion *U* -LRB- $ <unk> billion *U* -RRB- and would be among the world 's largest missile makers . 
After two years of talks , plans for the venture are sufficiently advanced for the companies to seek French and British government clearance . 
The companies hope for a final agreement by year-end . 
The venture would strengthen the rapidly growing ties between the two companies , and help make them a leading force in European defense contracting . 
In recent months , a string of <unk> mergers and joint ventures have <unk> the <unk> world of European arms manufacture . 
Already , British Aerospace and French <unk> <unk> <unk> on a British missile contract and on an air-traffic control radar system . 
Just last week they announced 0 they may make a joint bid * to buy <unk> International <unk> PLC , a smaller British defense contractor <unk> * by alleged accounting fraud at a U.S. unit . 
The sudden <unk> of British Aerospace and <unk> -- traditionally bitter competitors for Middle East and Third World weapons contracts -- is <unk> controversy in Western Europe 's defense industry . 
Most threatened * by closer British <unk> ties would be *T* their <unk> national rivals , including <unk> S.A. in France and Britain 's General Electric Co. PLC . 
But neither <unk> nor <unk> -- unrelated to Stamford , Conn.-based General Electric Co. -- are sitting quietly by as their competitors join forces . 
Yesterday , a source close to <unk> confirmed that his company may join the <unk> fight , as part of a possible consortium that *T* would bid against British Aerospace and <unk> . 
Companies with which <unk> has had talks about a possible joint <unk> bid *T* include <unk> , Britain 's <unk> Group PLC , West Germany 's Daimler-Benz AG , and France 's <unk> group . 
But it may be weeks before <unk> and its potential partners decide whether * to bid , the source indicated 0 *T* . 
<unk> plans first * to study <unk> 's financial accounts , which auditors recently said 0 *T* included # <unk> million *U* in <unk> contracts at a U.S. unit , International <unk> & Control Group , with which <unk> merged *T* last year . 
Also , any <unk> bid might be blocked * by British antitrust regulators ; <unk> is <unk> 's main competitor on several key <unk> contracts , and its purchase by <unk> may <unk> British Defense Ministry worries about concentration in the country 's defense industry . 
A consortium bid , however , would diminish <unk> 's direct role in <unk> and might <unk> <unk> ministry officials . 
A British Aerospace spokeswoman appeared <unk> by the prospect of a fight with <unk> for <unk> : `` <unk> is the name of the game , '' she said *T* . 
At least one potential <unk> partner , <unk> , insists 0 it is n't interested in <unk> . 
`` We have nothing 0 * to say *T* about this affair , which *T* does n't concern us , '' a <unk> official said *T* Sunday . 
The missile venture , the British Aerospace spokeswoman said 0 *T* , is a needed response to the `` new environment '' in defense contracting . 
For both Thomson and British Aerospace , earnings in their home markets have come under pressure from increasingly <unk> defense <unk> ; and Middle East sales , a traditional <unk> for both companies ' exports , have been hurt * by five years of weak oil prices . 
The venture 's importance for Thomson is great . 
Thomson feels 0 the future of its defense business depends on * building cooperation with other Europeans . 
The European defense industry is consolidating ; for instance , West Germany 's Siemens AG recently joined <unk> in a takeover of Britain 's Plessey Co. , and Daimler-Benz agreed * to buy <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> . 
In missiles , Thomson is already <unk> * by British Aerospace and by its home rival , France 's <unk> S.A. ; * to better compete , Thomson officials say 0 *T* , they need a partnership . 
* To justify 50-50 ownership of the planned venture , Thomson would make a cash payment to British Aerospace . 
<unk> revenue of British Aerospace 's missile business is about # <unk> million *U* , a Thomson spokesman said 0 *T* . 
British Aerospace 's chief missile products include its <unk> family of <unk> <unk> missiles . 
Thomson missile products , with about half British Aerospace 's annual revenue , include the <unk> <unk> missile family . 
<unk> <unk> Line Co. said 0 it will delay a proposed <unk> , <unk> million <unk> -LRB- <unk> <unk> million *U* -RRB- expansion of its system because Canada 's output of crude oil is shrinking . 
<unk> , Canada 's biggest oil pipeline operator and a major <unk> of crude to the U.S. , said 0 revised industry forecasts indicate that Canadian oil output will total about <unk> million barrels a day <unk> by 1991 , 8 % lower than a previous estimate . 
Canadian crude production averaged about <unk> million barrels a day <unk> during 1989 's first half , about 1 % below the 1988 level . 
`` The capability <unk> of existing fields to deliver oil is dropping , '' and oil exploration activity is also down dramatically , as many producers shift their emphasis to natural gas , said 0 *T* Ronald <unk> , vice president for government and industry relations with <unk> 's parent , <unk> Energy <unk> . 
Mr. <unk> said 0 volume on <unk> 's system is down about 2 % since January and is expected * to fall further , * making expansion unnecessary until perhaps the <unk> . 
`` There has been a swing of the <unk> back to the gas side , '' he said *T* . 
Many of Canada 's oil and gas producers say 0 the outlook for natural gas is better than it is *?* for oil , and have shifted their exploration and development budgets <unk> . 
The number of active drilling <unk> in Canada is down 30 % from a year ago , and the number of completed oil wells is `` down more than that , due to the increasing focus on gas exploration , '' said *T* Robert <unk> , manager of crude oil with Calgary 's Independent Petroleum Association of Canada , an industry group . 
Mr. <unk> said 0 the main reason for the production decline is shrinking output of light crude from mature , conventional fields in western Canada . 
<unk> <unk> about 75 % of all crude produced * in western Canada , and almost 60 % of <unk> 's total volume consists of light crude . 
Nearly all of the crude oil that Canada exports *T* to the U.S. is <unk> * on <unk> 's system , whose main line *T* runs from <unk> to major U.S. and Canadian cities in the Great Lakes region , including Chicago , Buffalo , Toronto and Montreal . 
Canada 's current oil exports to the U.S. total about 600,000 barrels a day , or about 9.1 % of net U.S. crude imports , said 0 *T* John <unk> , president of the New York-based Petroleum Industry Research Foundation . 
That ranks Canada as the <unk> source of imported crude , behind Saudi Arabia , Nigeria and Mexico . 
Mr. <unk> said 0 Canada 's declining crude output , combined with the <unk> output of U.S. crude , will help * <unk> U.S. reliance on oil from overseas , particularly the Middle East . 
`` It 's very much a growing concern . 
But when something is inevitable *T* , you learn * to live with it , '' he said *T* . 
Mr. <unk> stressed that the delay of <unk> 's proposed expansion <unk> n't by itself increase U.S. dependence on offshore crude , however , since Canadian imports are limited * in any case by Canada 's falling output . 
Under terms of its proposed <unk> expansion , which *T* would have required regulatory approval , <unk> intended * to add 200,000 barrels a day of additional capacity to its system , beginning with a modest expansion by 1991 . 
The system currently has a capacity of <unk> million barrels a day . 
<unk> Steel Industries Inc. expects * to report that third-quarter earnings dropped more than 50 % from the previous quarter as a result of reduced sales volume and increased costs . 
In the second quarter , the steelmaker had net income of $ <unk> million *U* or $ 1.25 *U* a share , including a pretax charge of $ 17 million *U* related to the settlement of a suit , on sales of $ <unk> billion *U* . 
The company said 0 normal seasonal <unk> and lost orders caused * by prolonged labor talks reduced shipments by 200,000 tons in the latest quarter , compared with the second quarter . 
At the same time , the <unk> business was hurt * by continued increases in materials costs and repair and maintenance expenses , as well as higher labor costs under its new contract . 
The <unk> business was hurt * by reduced margins and start-up costs associated with its Joseph T. <unk> & <unk> unit . 
The company said 0 it is beginning * to see some <unk> improvements <unk> in both the <unk> and <unk> segments , which *T* should result in improved results for the fourth quarter . 
<unk> said 0 its third-quarter results will be announced * later this week . 
In the year-earlier third quarter , when the industry was in the midst of a boom *T* , the company had net of $ 61 million *U* , or $ <unk> *U* a share , on sales of $ <unk> billion *U* . 
* <unk> the financial results of computer firms has been a tough job lately . 
* Take Microsoft Corp. , the largest maker of personal computer software and generally considered an industry <unk> . 
In July , the company stunned Wall Street with the prediction that growth in the personal computer business overall would be only 10 % <unk> in 1990 , a modest increase when * compared * with the <unk> expansion of years past *T* . 
Investors -- * taking this as a sign that a broad industry slump was in the <unk> -- reacted by * selling the company 's stock , which *T* lost $ 3.25 *U* that day * to close at $ 52 *U* in national over-the-counter trading . 
But that was all of three months ago . 
Last week , Microsoft said 0 it expects revenue for its first quarter ended Sept. 30 to increase 34 % . 
The announcement caused the company 's stock to surge $ 6.50 *U* * to close at $ <unk> *U* a share . 
Microsoft 's surprising strength is one example of the difficulty facing investors looking for <unk> about the financial health of the computer firms . 
`` It <unk> 's hard * to know what * to expect *T* at this point , '' said *T* Peter Rogers , an analyst at Robertson Stephens & <unk> . 
`` The industry <unk> <unk> . '' 
* To <unk> , Mr. Rogers said that of the 14 <unk> firms 0 he follows *T* , half *T* will report for their most recent quarter earnings below last year 's results , and half above those results . 
Among those companies expected * to have a down quarter are *T* Hewlett-Packard Co. , <unk> Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc. , generally solid performers in the past . 
International Business Machines Corp. also is expected * to report disappointing results . 
Apple Computer Inc. , meanwhile , is expected * to show improved earnings for the period ended <unk> . 
Another <unk> message comes from <unk> Inc. , a computer retailer . 
In July , the company reported that booming sales of new personal computers from Apple and IBM had resulted in net income more than doubling for its fourth quarter ended June 30 to $ 7.4 million *U* , or 23 cents a share . 
This month , however , <unk> warned investors that results for its first quarter ended Sept. 30 had n't met expectations . 
The company said 0 it expects earnings of 14 to 17 cents a share , down from 25 cents a share in the year-earlier period . 
While the earnings picture <unk> , observers say 0 the major forces expected * to shape the industry in the coming year are clearer . 
Companies will continue * to war over standards . 
In computer publishing , a battle over <unk> is hurting <unk> Systems Inc. , which *T* sells software that *T* controls the image produced * by printers and displays . 
Until recently , <unk> had a lock on the market for image software , but last month Apple , <unk> 's biggest customer , and Microsoft <unk> . 
Now the two firms are <unk> on an alternative to <unk> 's approach , and analysts say 0 they are likely * to carry IBM , the biggest seller of personal computers , along with them . 
The short-term outlook for <unk> 's business , however , appears strong . 
The company is beginning * to ship a new software program that *T* 's being <unk> * as a <unk> for owners of <unk> printers sold * by Apple . 
The program is aimed * at * improving the quality of printed material . 
John <unk> , <unk> 's chief executive officer , said 0 the Mountain <unk> , Calif. , company has been receiving 1,000 calls a day about the product since it was demonstrated * at a computer publishing conference several weeks ago . 
Meanwhile , competition between various operating systems , which *T* control the basic functions of a computer , <unk> trouble for software firms generally . 
`` It creates uncertainty and usually <unk> down sales , '' said *T* <unk> <unk> , an analyst at <unk> Financial Group . 
Mr. <unk> said 0 this probably is behind the expected weak performance of <unk> Corp. , maker of a widely used computer publishing program . 
He expects <unk> to report earnings of 21 cents a share on revenues of $ <unk> million *U* for its third quarter , compared with earnings of 30 cents a share on revenue of <unk> million in the year-earlier period . 
<unk> officials could n't be reached * for comment . 
On the other hand , the battle of the bus is expected * to grow increasingly irrelevant . 
A bus is the data highway within a computer . 
IBM is backing one type of bus called * <unk> , while the nine other leading computer makers , including <unk> and Compaq Computer Corp. , have chosen another method . 
`` <unk> do n't care about the bus , '' said *T* Daniel <unk> , an analyst at Goldman , Sachs & <unk> . 
He said 0 Apple 's family of Macintosh computers , for instance , uses four different buses `` and no one seems * to mind . '' 
The gap between winners and <unk> will grow . 
In personal computers , Apple , Compaq and IBM are expected * to tighten their hold on their business . 
At the same time , <unk> firms will continue * to lose ground . 
Some lagging competitors even may leave the personal computer business altogether . 
<unk> Technology , for instance , is considered * a candidate 0 *T* to sell its troubled operation . 
`` <unk> has done well * establishing a distribution business , but they have n't delivered products that *T* sell , '' said *T* <unk> Brown , an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities . 
Mr. Brown estimates 0 <unk> , whose terminals business *T* is strong , will report a loss of 12 cents a share for its quarter ended <unk> . 
<unk> makers will continue * to eat away at the business of more traditional computer firms . 
<unk> powerful <unk> computers , designed * with one or more <unk> as their `` <unk> , '' are expected * to increasingly take on functions carried out by more expensive <unk> and <unk> . 
`` The guys that *T* make traditional hardware are really being <unk> * by <unk> machines , '' said *T* Mr. <unk> . 
As a result of this trend , longtime <unk> <unk> , IBM and Digital Equipment Corp. are scrambling * to <unk> with <unk> systems of their own . 
But they will have * to act quickly . 
Mr. <unk> expects Compaq to <unk> a family of <unk> personal computers <unk> later this year that *T* are powerful enough * to serve as the hub for communications within large networks of <unk> machines . 
A <unk> of new computer companies also has targeted this `` <unk> '' market . 
<unk> <unk> <unk> For <unk> States 
<unk> IS <unk> a comeback . 
So are *T* Indiana , Ohio and Michigan . 
The population of all four states is on the <unk> , according to new Census Bureau estimates , following declines throughout the early 1980s . 
The gains , * to be sure , are rather small . 
Iowa , for instance , saw its population grow by <unk> people , or 0.4 % , between 1987 and 1988 , the Census Bureau says 0 *T* . 
Still , even that modest increase is good news for a state that *T* had n't grown at all since 1981 . 
Between 1987 and 1988 , North Dakota was the only state in the Midwest 0 *T* to lose population , a loss of 4,000 people . 
Six of the 12 <unk> states have been growing steadily since 1980 -- Illinois , Kansas , Minnesota , Missouri , South Dakota and Wisconsin . 
The Northeast has been holding its own in the population race . 
Seven of nine states have grown each year since 1980 , including New York , which *T* lost 4 % of its population during the 1970s . 
And although Pennsylvania and Massachusetts suffered slight declines earlier in the decade , they are growing again . 
At the same time , several states in the South and West have had their own population turnaround . 
Seven states that *T* grew in the early 1980s are now losing population -- West Virginia , Mississippi , Louisiana , Oklahoma , Montana , Wyoming and Alaska . 
Overall , though , the South and West still <unk> the Northeast and Midwest , and fast-growing states like Florida and California ensure that the pattern will continue . 
But the growth gap between the Sun Belt and other regions has clearly started * narrowing . 
More <unk> <unk> Their <unk> 
<unk> <unk> modern medicine , more couples are growing old together . 
And even after * losing a <unk> , more of the elderly are staying independent . 
A new Census Bureau study of the <unk> population shows that 64 % of people aged 65 to 74 <unk> were living with a <unk> in 1988 , up from 59 % in 1970 . 
This does n't mean 0 they 're less likely * to live alone , however . 
That share has remained at about 24 % since 1970 . 
What *T* has changed is that more of the young elderly are living with <unk> rather than with other relatives , such as children . 
In 1988 , 10 % of those aged 65 to 74 <unk> lived with relatives other than <unk> , down from 15 % in 1970 . 
As people get even older , many become <unk> . 
But even among those aged 75 and older , the share living with a <unk> rose slightly , to 40 % in 1988 from 38 % in 1970 . 
Like their younger counterparts , the older elderly are less likely * to live with other relatives . 
Only 17 % of those aged 75 and older lived with relatives other than <unk> in 1988 , down from 26 % in 1970 . 
The likelihood of * living alone beyond the age of 75 has increased to 40 % from 32 % . 
More people are remaining independent longer presumably because they are better off <unk> and financially . 
<unk> <unk> Most For the <unk> 
<unk> <unk> people place personal success and money above family . 
At least that 's what a survey by Ernst & Young and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> indicates *T* . 
<unk> of respondents said 0 they strongly felt the need * to be successful in their jobs , while fewer than half said 0 they strongly felt the need * to spend more time with their families . 
* <unk> successful in careers and spending the money 0 they make *T* are top priorities for this group . 
Unlike most studies of the affluent market , this survey excluded the <unk> . 
Average household income for the sample was $ <unk> *U* , and average net assets were reported * as $ <unk> *U* . 
The goal was * to learn about one of today 's fastest-growing income groups , the <unk> class . 
Although they represent only 2 % of the population , they control nearly one-third of <unk> income . 
<unk> the board , these consumers value quality , buy what they like *T* rather than just what they need *T* , and appreciate products that *T* are <unk> . 
Despite their considerable incomes and assets , 40 % of the respondents in the study do n't feel financially secure , and <unk> do n't feel that they have made it . 
<unk> percent do n't even feel 0 they are financially well off . 
Many of the affluent are n't comfortable with themselves , either . 
About 40 % do n't feel 0 they 're more able than others . 
While <unk> feel some guilt about * being affluent , only 25 % give $ 2,500 *U* or more to charity each year . 
<unk> percent attend religious services regularly ; at the same time , 60 % feel that in life one sometimes has * to compromise one 's principles . 
<unk> and <unk> 
THE <unk> of women and minorities who *T* hold jobs in top management in the nation 's largest banks has more than doubled since 1978 . 
The American Bankers Association says that women make up 47 % of officials and managers in the top 50 banks , up from 33 % in 1978 . 
The share of minorities in those positions has risen to 16 % from 12 % <unk> . 
<unk> personal income in the U.S. grew faster than inflation last year , according to the Bureau of Economic <unk> . 
The amount of income <unk> * up for each man , woman and child was $ <unk> *U* <unk> in 1988 , up 6.6 % from $ <unk> *U* in 1987 . 
<unk> <unk> personal income ranged from $ <unk> *U* in Mississippi to $ <unk> *U* in Connecticut <unk> . 
There are <unk> million students in college <unk> this fall , up 2 % from 1988 , the National Center for Education Statistics estimates 0 *T* . 
About 54 % are women , and 44 % are part-time students . 
This small Dallas suburb 's got trouble . 
<unk> with a capital <unk> and that <unk> with <unk> and that stands for pool . 
More than 30 years ago , Prof. Harold Hill , the <unk> man in <unk> <unk> 's `` The Music Man , '' warned the citizens of River City , Iowa , against the game . 
Now <unk> spirits on <unk> 's town council have barred the town 's <unk> hotel , the Grand <unk> , from * <unk> three free pool tables in its new <unk> . 
Mayor <unk> <unk> and two members of the council said 0 they were worried about * setting a precedent that *T* would permit pool <unk> along <unk> 's main street . 
And the mayor , in an <unk> that *T* bears a <unk> <unk> to Prof. Hill 's , warned that `` alcohol leads to betting , which *T* leads to fights . '' 
The council 's action is yet another blow to a sport that its fans claim 0 *T* has been <unk> * <unk> for years . 
`` Obviously they 're not in touch with what *T* 's going on , '' says *T* Tom <unk> , vice president of the National <unk> <unk> Association . 
<unk> is hot in New York and Chicago , he insists 0 *T* , where `` upscale , <unk> places '' are adding tables *T* . 
With today 's tougher <unk> driving laws , he adds 0 *T* , `` people do n't want * to just sit around and drink . '' 
Besides , <unk> behavior seems unlikely at the Grand <unk> , where rooms average $ 200 *U* a night *T* and the cheap mixed drinks go for $ 3.50 *U* a pop *T* . 
At the <unk> , manager Elizabeth <unk> <unk> n't admit <unk> in jeans , <unk> or tennis shoes . 
But a majority of the <unk> council did n't buy those arguments . 
* <unk> pool , argued 0 *T* <unk> <unk> <unk> , would be `` dangerous . 
It would open a can of <unk> . '' 
<unk> is no <unk> to cans of <unk> , either . 
After its previous mayor committed suicide last year , an investigation disclosed that town officials regularly voted on their own projects , gave special favors to developer friends and dipped into the town 's <unk> for trips and <unk> . 
The <unk> <unk> town officials , although they argued that the problems were n't as severe as the media suggested 0 *?* . 
Now comes the pool <unk> . 
`` I think 0 there 's some people worried about something pretty ridiculous , '' <unk> John <unk> says *T* . 
`` I thought 0 this was all taken care of * in <unk> The Music Man . 
The only thing 0 Robert Goldberg could praise *T* about CBS 's new show `` Island <unk> '' -LRB- <unk> & Arts , Sept. 25 -RRB- was the local color ; <unk> neither he nor the producers of the show have done their <unk> . 
For instance : `` <unk> '' -LRB- white -RRB- is not the ultimate <unk> ; `` <unk> <unk> '' is *?* . 
Richard <unk> <unk> as a `` <unk> <unk> , '' * <unk> in a <unk> shirt and rolling up its long <unk> . 
And the local expression for brother is `` <unk> , '' not `` <unk> . '' 
And even if a <unk> would wear <unk> in her hair while * on duty , if she were engaged she would know * to wear them behind her left , not right , <unk> . 
<unk> , the show does not even have the one <unk> quality of genuine local color . 
<unk> Davis 
Of all the ethnic tensions in America , which *T* *T* is the most <unk> right now ? 
A good bet would be the tension between blacks and Jews in New York City . 
Or so it must seem *T* to <unk> Mason , the veteran Jewish <unk> appearing in a new ABC <unk> <unk> on Tuesday nights -LRB- <unk> p.m. EDT -RRB- . 
Not only is <unk> Mr. Mason the star of `` <unk> <unk> , '' he 's also the <unk> of a <unk> tradition <unk> back to `` <unk> <unk> , '' and he 's currently a man in hot water . 
Here , in neutral language , is *T* the <unk> of Mr. Mason 's remarks , quoted * first in the Village <unk> while he was a paid spokesman for the <unk> Giuliani <unk> campaign , and then in <unk> after he and the campaign <unk> company . 
Mr. Mason said that many Jewish voters feel guilty toward blacks , so they support black candidates <unk> . 
He said that many black voters feel bitter about racial discrimination , so they , too , support black candidates <unk> . 
He said that Jews have contributed more <unk> to black causes over the years than vice <unk> . 
Of course , Mr. Mason did not use neutral language . 
As a <unk> of ethnic humor from the old days on the <unk> Belt , live television and the <unk> circuit , Mr. Mason <unk> reached for the <unk> . 
He said 0 Jews were `` sick with <unk> '' ; and he called David <unk> , Mr. Giuliani 's black opponent , `` a fancy <unk> with a <unk> . '' 
If Mr. Mason had used less <unk> language * to <unk> his <unk> analysis of the voting behavior of his fellow New <unk> , would the water be quite so hot ? 
It probably would *?* , because few or none of the people upset by Mr. Mason 's remarks have <unk> * to <unk> between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used <unk> language . 
In addition , some of Mr. Mason 's critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of <unk> . 
For example , the New York state counsel for the <unk> said that Mr. Mason is `` like a <unk> . 
People are fast leaving the place where he is stuck *T* . '' 
These critics fail * to <unk> between the type of ethnic humor that *T* aims at * <unk> another group , such as `` Polish jokes '' ; and the type that *T* is <unk> , * <unk> <unk> as well as <unk> . 
The latter typically is the humor of the <unk> , and it was <unk> * by both blacks and Jews on the <unk> and <unk> stage as a means of * <unk> their white and <unk> audiences along with themselves . 
In the hands of a <unk> like <unk> Bruce , this <unk> <unk> could cut both the <unk> and the audience to <unk> . 
But * <unk> * by a pro like <unk> Mason , it is a constructive form of <unk> . 
Why constructive ? 
Because despite all the media <unk> about comedy and politics not <unk> , they are similar in one respect : Both can serve as mechanisms for * easing tensions and <unk> the <unk> of groups in conflict . 
That 's why it <unk> 's dangerous * to have <unk> thought police , on college <unk> and elsewhere , <unk> all critical mention of group differences *T* . 
As Elizabeth <unk> wrote in the New York Times just before the Mason <unk> , `` Perhaps <unk> would not <unk> over with such <unk> if honest differences were allowed * to <unk> . '' 
The question is , if group conflicts still exist -LRB- as <unk> they do *?* -RRB- , and if Mr. Mason 's type of ethnic humor is <unk> , then what other means <unk> do we have *T* for * letting off steam ? 
* Do n't say 0 the TV <unk> , because that happens * to be a <unk> that , in its desperate need * to attract everybody and <unk> nobody , *T* <unk> politics more than it does *?* comedy . 
It <unk> is true that the best <unk> do allow group differences to <unk> : <unk> vs. blue-collar <unk> in `` <unk> '' ; children vs. adults in `` The Cosby Show . '' 
But these are not the differences that *T* make headlines . 
In `` <unk> <unk> , '' Mr. Mason plays <unk> , a Jewish <unk> <unk> <unk> -LRB- <unk> <unk> -RRB- , an Irish <unk> and mother of three , against the wishes of his mother -LRB- <unk> <unk> -RRB- and her brother Michael -LRB- <unk> <unk> -RRB- . 
It <unk> 's worth noting that both <unk> relatives are immigrants . 
At least , they both speak with strong <unk> , as do *?* <unk> and <unk> . 
It <unk> could n't be more obvious that `` <unk> <unk> '' is being made * from an old <unk> . 
And a safe one -- * imagine if the <unk> in question were between an <unk> <unk> and a member of the <unk> of <unk> . 
Back in the <unk> , the play and movie versions of `` <unk> 's Irish Rose '' made the theme of <unk> between the <unk> <unk> of Jewish and Irish immigrants so popular that its author , Anne Nichols , lost a <unk> suit on the grounds that the plot has entered the public <unk> . 
And it has remained there , as * <unk> * by its <unk> in a 1972 CBS <unk> called * `` <unk> <unk> <unk> , '' whose sole distinction *T* was that it led to the <unk> marriage of <unk> Baxter and David <unk> . 
Clearly , the question with `` <unk> <unk> '' is not whether the <unk> will <unk> over , but whether it will <unk> at all . 
So far , the <unk> have been few and far between . 
Part of the problem is the tendency <unk> of all <unk> , ever since the <unk> days of Norman Lear , * to <unk> about social issues . 
To some extent , this tendency emerges whenever the show tries * to <unk> us about ethnic <unk> by * reversing them *T* . 
For instance , Michael <unk> <unk> not because he 's a <unk> Jewish businessman , but because he <unk> his <unk> job as a salesman in order * to become a social worker . 
Even more <unk> is *T* the <unk> between <unk> <unk> and Mr. Mason 's comic <unk> . 
The best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end -LRB- and occasionally in the middle -RRB- , when Mr. Mason <unk> into his <unk> <unk> *T* and starts * <unk> out that old-fashioned Jewish <unk> to other people as well as to himself *T* . 
But too often , these <unk> lack spark because this <unk> , like all <unk> , is <unk> about * <unk> Mr. Mason 's stock in trade - ethnic differences . 
I 'm not suggesting that the producers start * putting together <unk> about topics like the <unk> dispute over the <unk> <unk> at <unk> . 
That issue , like racial tensions in New York City , will have * to cool down , not heat up , before it can <unk> . 
But I am suggesting that they stop requiring Mr. Mason to <unk> his classic <unk> with some line about `` * <unk> for other people '' that *T* would sound <unk> on the <unk> of Miss America . 
At your age , <unk> , you ought * to know that you <unk> n't make <unk> without * turning up the <unk> . 
The official White House reaction to a plunge in stock prices has a <unk> history of calm , right up through Friday . 
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said in a statement Friday that the stock-market decline `` does n't signal any fundamental change in the condition of the economy . '' 
`` The economy , '' he added 0 *T* , `` remains <unk> and the outlook is for continued moderate growth . '' 
* Sound familiar ? 
Here 's *T* what Ronald Reagan said *T* after the 1987 crash : `` The underlying economy remains sound . 
There is nothing wrong with the economy <unk> all the <unk> are up . '' 
* <unk> that before ? 
After the 1929 crash , Herbert Hoover said : 0 `` The fundamental business of the country <unk> is on a sound and <unk> basis . 
James Robinson , 57 years old , was elected * president and chief executive officer of this maker of magnetic recording heads for disk drives . 
He has been president and chief executive officer of <unk> Electronics Corp. , a division of North American Philips Corp. , itself a subsidiary of <unk> . Philips of the Netherlands . 
Charles J. Lawson Jr. , 68 , who *T* had been acting chief executive since June 14 , will continue as chairman . 
The former president and chief executive , Eric W. <unk> , resigned in June . 
The Senate 's decision * to approve a <unk> deficit-reduction bill without a capital-gains tax cut still leaves open the possibility of * <unk> a gains tax reduction this year . 
Late Friday night , the Senate voted <unk> * to approve an estimated $ 13.5 billion *U* measure that *T* had been stripped * of hundreds of provisions that *T* would have widened , rather than narrowed , the federal budget deficit . 
Lawmakers drastically <unk> the bill * to blunt criticism that it was <unk> with <unk> tax breaks and spending increases . 
`` We 're putting a deficit-reduction bill back in the category of * being a deficit-reduction bill , '' said *T* Senate Budget Committee Chairman James <unk> -LRB- D. , <unk> . -RRB- . 
But Senate supporters of the <unk> legislation said that other bills <unk> would soon be moving through Congress that *T* could carry some of the measures that *T* had been cast * aside , including a capital-gains tax cut . 
In addition , the <unk> deficit-reduction bill already passed * by the House includes a capital-gains provision . 
House-Senate negotiations are likely * to begin at <unk> and last for a while . 
`` No one can predict exactly what *T* will happen on the House side , '' said *T* Senate <unk> Leader Robert Dole -LRB- R. , <unk> . -RRB- . 
But , he added 0 *T* , `` I believe 0 Republicans and Democrats will work together * to get capital-gains reform this year . '' 
White House Budget Director Richard <unk> told reporters yesterday that the administration would n't push * to keep the capital-gains cut in the final version of the bill . 
`` We do n't need this as a way 0 * to get capital gains *T* , '' he said *T* . 
House Budget Committee Chairman Leon <unk> -LRB- D. , <unk> . -RRB- said in an interview , 0 `` If that 's the signal that *T* comes from the White House , that will help a great deal . '' 
The Senate 's decision was a setback for President Bush and will make approval of a capital-gains tax cut less certain this year . 
<unk> of the cut are playing <unk> . 
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell -LRB- D. , Maine -RRB- said 0 he was `` confident '' that any House-Senate agreement on the deficit-reduction legislation would n't include a capital-gains tax cut . 
And a senior aide to the House Ways and Means Committee , where tax legislation <unk> *T* , said 0 there are n't any `` plans * to produce another tax bill that *T* could carry a gains tax cut this year . '' 
One obvious place 0 * to <unk> a capital-gains tax cut , and perhaps other popular items stripped * from the deficit-reduction bill , *T* is the legislation 0 *T* to raise the federal borrowing limit . 
Such legislation must be enacted * by the end of the month . 
The Senate bill was <unk> * back in an attempt * to speed deficit-reduction through Congress . 
Because the legislation has n't been completed * , President Bush has until midnight tonight * to enact across-the-board spending cuts mandated * by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law . 
<unk> hope that the need * to avoid those cuts will pressure the House to agree to the <unk> bill . 
The House appears reluctant * to join the senators . 
A key is whether House Republicans are willing * to <unk> to their Senate colleagues ' decision * to drop many pet provisions . 
`` Although I am encouraged * by the Senate action , '' said *T* Chairman Dan Rostenkowski -LRB- D. , <unk> . -RRB- of the House Ways and Means Committee , `` it <unk> is uncertain whether a clean bill can be achieved * in the <unk> conference with the Senate . '' 
Another big question <unk> over the debate is what President Bush thinks *T* . 
He has been <unk> a <unk> bill without a guaranteed vote on his capital-gains tax cut . 
But Republican senators saw no way 0 * to overcome a <unk> hurdle *T* and <unk> the 60 votes needed * * to win the capital-gains issue on the floor *T* , so they went ahead with the <unk> bill . 
The Senate bill was stripped * of many popular , though <unk> , provisions , a number of which *T* are included * in the <unk> bill . 
These include a child-care initiative and <unk> of <unk> tax breaks for low-income housing and <unk> expenditures . 
Also missing from the Senate bill is *T* the House 's repeal of a law , called * Section 89 , that *T* <unk> companies to give <unk> workers comparable health benefits to top paid executives . 
One <unk> provision that *T* was originally in the Senate bill but was cut * out because it lost money was the proposal <unk> by Chairman Lloyd Bentsen -LRB- D. , Texas -RRB- of the Senate Finance Committee * to expand the deduction for individual retirement accounts . 
Mr. Bentsen said 0 he hopes 0 the Senate will consider that measure soon . 
To the <unk> of some doctors , the bill dropped a plan passed * by the Finance Committee that *T* would have <unk> the entire <unk> system under Medicare . 
To the <unk> of many low-income people , efforts * to boost Medicaid funding , especially in rural areas , also were <unk> * . 
* Asked * why senators were giving up so much *T* , New Mexico Sen. Pete <unk> , the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee , said , 0 `` We 're looking like <unk> . 
Things had just gone too far . '' 
Sen. Dole said that the move required sacrifice by every senator . 
It worked , others said 0 *T* , because there were no exceptions : all <unk> provisions were <unk> * . 
The Senate also dropped a plan by its Finance Committee that *T* would have increased the income threshold beyond which senior citizens have their Social Security benefits reduced * *T* . 
In addition , the bill dropped a plan * to make permanent a 3 % excise tax on long-distance telephone calls . 
It no longer includes a plan that *T* would have <unk> what *T* remains of the <unk> method of accounting , which *T* is used * by military contractors * to reduce their tax burden . 
It also drops a provision that *T* would have permitted corporations to use excess pension funds * to pay health benefits for current retirees . 
Also <unk> * was *T* a <unk> increase in the maximum <unk> Safety and Health Administration penalties , which *T* would have raised $ 65 million *U* in fiscal 1990 . 
A provision that *T* would have made the Social Security Administration an independent agency was <unk> * . 
The approval of the Senate bill was especially sweet for Sen. Mitchell , who *T* had proposed the <unk> . 
Mr. Mitchell 's relations with Budget Director <unk> , who *T* pushed for a capital-gains cut to be added * to the measure , have been strained * since Mr. <unk> chose * to bypass the Maine Democrat and deal with other lawmakers earlier this year during a dispute over drug funding in the fiscal 1989 <unk> spending bill . 
The deficit reduction bill contains $ 5.3 billion *U* in tax increases in fiscal 1990 , and $ 26 billion *U* over five years . 
The <unk> provisions , which *T* affect mostly corporations , would : 
-- <unk> companies that *T* have made leveraged buy-outs from * getting federal tax refunds resulting from losses caused * by interest payments on debt issued * * to finance the buy-outs , effective Aug. 2 , 1989 .

In response to your overly optimistic , <unk> piece on how long unemployment <unk> *T* -LRB- People <unk> , Sept. 20 -RRB- : I am in the communications field , above entry level . 
I was laid * off in August 1988 , and after a <unk> and <unk> job search , was hired * in August 1989 . 
My unemployment insurance ran out before I found a job ; I found cutbacks and layoffs in many companies . 
The statistics quoted * by the `` new '' Census Bureau report -LRB- <unk> * from 1984 to 1986 -RRB- are out of date , certainly as an average for the Northeast , and possibly for the rest of the country . 
I think 0 what *T* <unk> me most about the piece was that there seemed * to be an underlying attitude * to tell your readers 0 all is well -- if you 're getting laid * off * do n't worry , and if you 're unemployed , it 's a seller 's market . 
* To top it off , you <unk> the <unk> showing the average number of months in a job search as `` Time <unk> . '' 
Are you <unk> ? 
* Looking for a job was one of the most anxious periods of my life -- and is *?* for most people . 
Your paper needs a serious reality check .

Moody 's Investors Service Inc. said 0 it downgraded its rating <unk> to <unk> from <unk> on less than $ 20 million *U* of this thrift 's senior subordinated notes . 
The rating concern said 0 Franklin 's `` troubled diversification record in the securities business '' was one reason for the downgrade , * citing the troubles at its L.F. Rothschild subsidiary and the possible sale of other subsidiaries . 
`` They perhaps had concern that we were getting out of all these , '' said *T* Franklin President <unk> H. Hall . 
`` I think 0 it was a little premature on their part . 
Just when it <unk> seemed safe * to go back into stocks *T* , Wall Street suffered another severe attack of <unk> . 
Does this signal 0 another Black Monday is coming ? 
Or is this an extraordinary buying opportunity , just like Oct. 19 , 1987 , eventually turned out * to be *?* ? 
Here 's *T* what several leading market experts and money managers say *T* about Friday 's action , what *T* happens next and what investors should do *T* . 
Joseph <unk> . 
`` I 'm the only one who *T* said 0 there would be an October <unk> , all through late August and September , '' says *T* Mr. <unk> , once a widely followed market <unk> and still a well-known newsletter writer . 
`` Everyone will tell you that this time is different from 1987 , '' he says *T* . 
`` Well , in some ways it is different , but technically it is just the same . 
If you 're a <unk> , you <unk> the signals . 
Right now they 're telling me * to get the hell out and stay out . 
I see no major support until <unk> . 
I see a possibility of * going to <unk> this month . '' 
Mr. <unk> says 0 he would n't even think of buying until at least 600 to 700 stocks have hit 52-week lows ; about 100 stocks hit new lows Friday . 
`` Most people , '' he says *T* , `` have no idea what a <unk> pattern looks like *T* . '' 
<unk> <unk> . 
* A <unk> analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. , Ms. <unk> had warned clients to take their money out of the market before the 1987 crash . 
Friday 's big drop , she says 0 *T* , `` was not a crash . 
This was an October <unk> '' like those that *T* occurred in 1978 and 1979 . 
Now , as in those two years , her stock market indicators are positive . 
So she thinks 0 the damage will be <unk> and contained . 
`` Those <unk> lasted one to four weeks and took the market <unk> % *U* down , '' she says *T* . 
`` This is exactly the same thing , as far as I 'm concerned * . '' 
Thus , she says 0 *T* , if the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped below <unk> , `` It would just be a <unk> . 
My advice is * to buy . '' 
As she <unk> it , the average stock now sells for about 12.5 times companies ' earnings . 
She says 0 that ratio could climb to 14.5 , given current interest rates , and still be within the range of `` fair value . '' 
<unk> Davis . 
Friday 's fall marks the start of a bear market , says 0 *T* Mr. Davis , president of <unk> Davis Research <unk> . 
But Mr. Davis , whose views *T* are widely respected * by money managers , says 0 he expects no <unk> crash . 
`` There was a unique combination in 1987 , '' he says *T* . 
`` <unk> debt was at a record high . 
There was tremendous public enthusiasm for stock mutual funds . 
The main thing was portfolio insurance , '' a mechanical trading system intended * to protect an investor against losses . `` 
A hundred billion dollars in stock was subject '' to it . 
In 1987 , such selling contributed to a <unk> effect . 
Today could even be an up day , Mr. Davis says 0 *T* , if major brokerage firms agree * to refrain from program trading . 
Over the next several months , though , he says 0 things look bad . 
`` I think 0 the market will be heading down into November , '' he says *T* . 
`` We will probably have a year-end rally , and then go down again . 
<unk> of a <unk> bear market . '' 
He expects the downturn to carry the Dow Jones Industrial Average down to around 2000 sometime next year . 
`` That would be a normal bear market , '' he says *T* . 
`` I guess 0 that 's my forecast . '' 
Leon G. <unk> . 
`` I do n't think 0 the market is going through another October <unk> . 
I do n't think 0 that 's the case at all , '' says *T* Mr. <unk> , a partner at Goldman , Sachs & Co. and chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management . 
Mr. <unk> sees this as a good time 0 * to pick up bargains *T* , but he does n't think 0 there 's any need * to rush . 
`` I expect the market to open * weaker Monday , but then it should find some stability . '' 
He <unk> off several major differences between now and two years ago . 
Unlike 1987 , interest rates have been falling this year . 
Unlike 1987 , the dollar has been strong . 
And unlike 1987 , the economy does n't appear * to be in any danger of <unk> . 
But the economy 's slower growth this year also means 0 the outlook for corporate profits `` is n't good , '' he says 0 *T* . 
`` So it 's a very mixed bag . '' 
Thus , he concludes 0 *T* , `` This is not a good environment 0 * to be fully invested '' in stocks *T* . 
`` If I had come into Friday on margin or with very little cash in the portfolios , I would not do any buying . 
But we came into Friday with a conservative portfolio , so I would look * to do some modest buying '' on behalf of clients . `` 
We 're going * to look for some of the <unk> companies that *T* got <unk> * '' Friday . 
John Kenneth <unk> . 
`` This is the latest <unk> of the capacity of the financial community for <unk> <unk> , '' says *T* Mr. <unk> , an economist . 
`` I see this as a reaction to the whole junk bond explosion , '' he says *T* . 
`` The explosion of junk bonds and takeovers has <unk> a lot of <unk> securities in the hands of investors and loaded the corporations that *T* are the objects of takeovers or feared takeovers with huge amounts of debt rather than equity . 
This has both made investors <unk> and the corporations more vulnerable . '' 
Nevertheless , he says 0 a depression does n't appear likely . 
`` There is more <unk> in the economy at large than we commonly <unk> 0 *?* , '' he says . 
`` It takes more error <unk> now * to have a major depression than back in the <unk> -- much as the financial community and the government may try *?* . '' 
Mario Gabelli . 
New York money manager Mario Gabelli , an expert at * <unk> takeover candidates , says that takeovers are n't totally gone . 
`` Companies are still going * to buy companies around the world , '' he says *T* . 
<unk> are `` Ford looking at Jaguar , BellSouth looking at LIN Broadcasting . '' 
These sorts of takeovers do n't require junk bonds or big bank loans * to finance them , so Mr. Gabelli figures 0 they will continue . 
`` The market was up 35 % since -LCB- President -RCB- Bush took office , '' Mr. Gabelli says 0 *T* , so a correction was * to be expected * . 
He thinks 0 another crash is `` unlikely , '' and says 0 he was `` <unk> at '' selected stocks during Friday 's plunge . 
`` Stocks that *T* were thrown * out just on an emotional basis are a great opportunity <unk> -LCB- this -RCB- week for guys like me , '' he says *T* . 
Jim Rogers . 
`` It seems to me that this is the <unk> that *T* has finally <unk> the <unk> , '' says *T* Mr. Rogers , a professor of finance at Columbia University and former <unk> of one of the most successful hedge funds in history , Quantum Fund . 
He sees `` economic problems , financial problems '' ahead for the U.S. , with a fairly strong possibility of a recession . 
`` Friday you could n't sell dollars , '' he says *T* . 
Dealers `` would give you a quote , but then refuse * to make the trade . '' 
If the dollar stays weak , he says 0 *T* , that will add to inflationary pressures in the U.S. and make it <unk> hard for the Federal Reserve Board to ease interest rates very much . 
Mr. Rogers <unk> n't decide what * to do *T* today until he sees how the London and Tokyo markets go *T* . 
He recommends that investors sell <unk> stocks , but hang on to some other stocks -- especially utilities , which *T* often do well during periods of economic weakness . 
Frank <unk> . 
Many people now claim * to have predicted the 1987 crash . 
<unk> newsletter writer Francis <unk> <unk> actually did it : He stated in writing in September 1987 that the Dow Jones Industrial Average was likely * to decline about 500 points the following month . 
Mr. <unk> says 0 what *T* happens now will depend a good deal on the Federal Reserve Board . 
If it promptly cuts the discount rate 0 it charges *T* on loans to banks , he says 0 *T* , `` That could quiet things down . '' 
If not , `` We could go to <unk> very soon . '' 
Frank W. <unk> . 
Stock prices `` would still have * to go down some additional amount before we become positive on stocks , '' says 0 *T* Mr. <unk> , president and managing director of <unk> Investment Management Inc. in Cincinnati . 
<unk> , which *T* manages about $ 1.8 billion *U* , drew stiff criticism from many clients earlier this year because it pulled entirely out of stocks at the beginning of the year and thus missed a strong rally . 
<unk> is keeping its money entirely in cash <unk> , primarily U.S. Treasury bills . 
`` <unk> probably are the right place 0 * to be *T* , '' he says *T* . 
* <unk> the Oct. 3 letter to the editor from Rep. Tom <unk> , chairman of the House <unk> on Employment and Housing , alleging : 
1 . That your Sept. 28 editorial `` <unk> <unk> '' was <unk> inaccurate and deliberately misleading . 
I thought 0 your editorial was <unk> accurate and deliberately <unk> . 
2 . That Mr. <unk> supported the rights <unk> of the witnesses * to take the Fifth Amendment . 
Yes , he did . 
As I watched him on <unk> , I heard 0 him speak those <unk> words about the Bill of Rights , which he quotes *T* from the <unk> of the hearings . 
He did repeat those nice <unk> several times as an indication of his support for the Constitution . 
He used about 56 words * defending the witnesses ' constitutional rights . 
Unfortunately , by my rough guess , he used better than 5,000 words * <unk> <unk> on the witnesses for * <unk> the Fifth . 
He <unk> his praise of constitutional meat between large <unk> of <unk> <unk> . 
As your editorial <unk> pointed out , Samuel Pierce , former HUD secretary , and <unk> Wilson , Mr. Pierce 's former aide , `` are currently being held * up to <unk> for * taking the Fifth Amendment . 
'' That certainly is not the supposed `` <unk> reading '' indicated * by Mr. <unk> . 
3 . That his `` committee does not deal with any possible criminal activity at HUD . 
My colleagues and I fully realize 0 we are not a court <unk> <unk> . '' 
<unk> <unk> . 
By any `` reasonable man '' <unk> , Mr. <unk> and his colleagues have a whole bunch of people tried and convicted . 
Apparently , their verdict is in . 
Right now they 're pursuing evidence . 
That 's not a bad way 0 * to proceed *T* , just somewhat different from standard American practice . 
How was that practice referred to * *T* when I was in school *T* ? 
<unk> , yes , something called * a Star Chamber . 
Of course , Mr. <unk> <unk> protest that his subcommittee simply seeks information for legislative change . 
No doubt 0 that 's partially true . 
Everything that Mr. <unk> says *T* in his letter is partially true . 
He 's right about his subcommittee 's responsibilities when it comes to * obtaining information from prior HUD officials *T* . 
But if his explanation of <unk> is true , why is his investigation so <unk> * as * to identify criminal activity *T* ? 
Why not simply questions designed * to identify sources and causes of waste and <unk> ? 
Such as , what *T* happened when Congress wanted * to know about $ 400 *U* <unk> seats or whatever they supposedly cost *T* *T* ? 
No , Mr. <unk> 's complaints simply <unk> n't <unk> . 
4 . That the Journal <unk> `` the <unk> , fraud , waste , <unk> , <unk> and abuse of the public that *T* took place while Mr. Pierce was secretary of HUD , '' <unk> and so forth . 
No , to my mind , the Journal did not `` defend <unk> , fraud , waste , <unk> , <unk> and abuse of the public trust <unk> '' 
it defended appropriate constitutional <unk> and practical common sense . 
The problem , which the Journal so <unk> pointed *T* out in a number of articles , is not the likes of Mr. <unk> , who *T* after all is really a bit player on the stage , but the attempt <unk> by Congress * to enhance itself into a <unk> body . 
-LRB- Of course , we 've also got a <unk> that *T* seeks the same objective . -RRB- 
The system is the problem , not an individual member . 
<unk> can always have their hands <unk> * . 
It 's when such <unk> does n't occur *T* that we 've got trouble *T* . 
I do not by any means defend HUD management . 
But I think 0 the kind of congressional investigation that *T* has been pursued * is a far greater danger to American <unk> of <unk> and freedom than any <unk> -LRB- and , yes , maybe <unk> -RRB- within HUD could possibly generate *?* . 
The last time 0 I saw a similar congressional hearing *T* was when `` <unk> <unk> Joe '' McCarthy did his work *T* . 
Raymond <unk> 
<unk> , <unk> . 
I disagree with the statement <unk> by Mr. <unk> that one should not draw an adverse <unk> against former HUD officials who *T* assert their Fifth Amendment privilege against <unk> in congressional hearings . 
The Fifth Amendment states in relevant part that no person `` shall be compelled , in any criminal case , * to be a witness against himself . '' 
This privilege against <unk> <unk> the drawing of an adverse <unk> against a criminal defendant who *T* <unk> not * to testify . 
Thus , in a criminal case , a prosecutor can not comment on a defendant 's failure * to testify nor can the defendant be compelled * to take the stand as a witness , thus * forcing him to `` take the Fifth . '' 
The privilege , however , has been limited in <unk> with its plain language * to protect the defendant in criminal matters only . 
The Supreme Court and some states have specifically recognized that `` the Fifth Amendment does not <unk> the <unk> where the privilege is claimed * by a party to a civil cause *T* . '' 
Baxter <unk> <unk> , <unk> U.S. <unk> -LRB- 1976 -RRB- . 
Thus , in a civil case , a defendant may be called * as a witness , he may be forced * to testify or take the Fifth , and his taking of the Fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse <unk> against him in the civil matter . 
He may take the Fifth in a civil matter only if he has a good faith <unk> and <unk> belief <unk> that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution . 
* <unk> the defendant to take the Fifth in a civil matter is not based * on a constitutional right * to refuse * to testify where one 's testimony <unk> him in the civil matter *T* , but because the testimony in the civil matter could be <unk> used * against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution . 
<unk> the risk of such prosecution , a court may order the defendant * to testify . 
Thus , when Mr. Pierce asserted the Fifth in a <unk> proceeding , particularly after * presumably receiving extensive advice from legal counsel *T* , one must conclude that he held a <unk> , <unk> belief that his testimony could be used * against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution . 
The subcommittee , Congress and the American public have every right * to draw the adverse <unk> and to <unk> with Mr. Pierce 's own belief that his testimony could help * <unk> him of a crime . 
* <unk> the adverse <unk> in a <unk> congressional hearing does not <unk> the Fifth Amendment shield against <unk> . 
Clark S. <unk> <unk> . 
<unk> Park , <unk> . 
It was Friday the <unk> , and the stock market plummeted nearly 200 points . 
Just a <unk> ? 
Or is <unk> -- fear of the number 13 -- justified ? 
In <unk> , a so-called Friday the <unk> effect has been set * up and shot * down by different professors . 
Robert <unk> and <unk> <unk> , professors of finance at the University of Miami , found evidence that the market is <unk> * by Friday the <unk> . 
But their study , which *T* <unk> the <unk> period , has since been shown * to be <unk> * by an <unk> choice of data . 
In the <unk> , the market took falls nine times in a row on Friday the <unk> . 
But the date tends * to be a plus , not a minus , for stocks , according to Yale Hirsch , a <unk> of stock market <unk> . 
Another study found that the 82 <unk> the <unk> in the <unk> period had higher than average returns -- higher even than <unk> in general , which *T* tend * to be strong days for stock prices . 
On the only other Friday the <unk> this year , the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about four points . 
<unk> <unk> says 0 the original study , <unk> * Friday the <unk> , Part <unk> , was published * <unk> . 
In a similar <unk> , he adds that the anniversary of the 1987 crash and Saturday 's full <unk> could have played a part , too , in Friday 's market activity . 
<unk> of those during the 1987 crash -- that as stock prices plummeted and trading activity <unk> , some phone calls to market makers in over-the-counter stocks went <unk> . 
`` We could n't get dealers to answer their phones , '' said *T* Robert King , senior vice president of OTC trading at <unk> Co. in Atlanta . 
`` It was -LCB- like -RCB- the Friday before Black Monday '' two years ago . 
Whether <unk> phone calls had any effect or not , Nasdaq stocks sank far less than those on the New York and American exchanges . 
Nonetheless , the Nasdaq Composite Index suffered its biggest point decline of the year and its sixth worst ever , * <unk> <unk> , or 3 % , to <unk> . 
Ten points of the drop occurred during the last 45 minutes of trading . 
By comparison , the New York Stock Exchange Composite tumbled 5.8 % Friday and the American Stock Exchange Composite fell 4 % . 
On Oct. 16 , 1987 , the Nasdaq Composite fell <unk> points , or 3.8 % , * followed * by its devastating <unk> , or 11 % slide , three days later . 
Nasdaq volume Friday totaled <unk> million shares , which *T* was only the fifth <unk> day so far this year . 
The <unk> record of <unk> million shares was set * on Oct. 21 , 
`` There was n't a lot of volume because it <unk> was just impossible * to get stock moved * , '' said *T* <unk> `` <unk> '' <unk> , president of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , a New York company that *T* makes markets in thousands of OTC issues . 
Most of the complaints about <unk> phone calls came from regional brokers rather than individual investors . 
Mr. King of <unk> and others were quick * to add that they believe 0 the problem stemmed more from traders ' inability * to handle the volume of calls , rather than a <unk> attempt * to avoid * making trades . 
The subject is a <unk> one for Nasdaq and its <unk> companies , which *T* were widely criticized * two years ago following complaints from investors who *T* could n't reach their brokers or trade in the chaos of the crash . 
Peter <unk> , head of retail equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton , declared : 0 `` It was the last hour of trading on a Friday . 
There were too many phones <unk> and too many things happening * to expect market makers to be as efficient as <unk> . 
It was n't <unk> , we were all busy . '' 
James <unk> , head of OTC trading at <unk> & <unk> in San Francisco , said , 0 `` It was just like two years ago . 
Everybody was trying * to do the same thing at the same time . '' 
<unk> <unk> , the OTC trading chief at Dean Witter Reynolds in New York , said <unk> that his company executed every order 0 it received *T* by the close of trading . 
But , he added 0 *T* , `` you can only take one call at a time . '' 
Market makers keep supplies of stock on hand * to maintain orderly trading when imbalances occur *T* . 
On days like Friday , that means 0 they must buy shares from sellers when no one else is willing * to *?* *T* . 
When selling is so <unk> *T* , prices fall <unk> and fast . 
Two years ago , * faced * with the possibility of heavy losses on the stocks in their inventories , market makers themselves began * dumping shares , * <unk> the slide in OTC stock prices . 
On Friday , some market makers were selling again , traders said 0 *T* . 
But , with profits sagging on Wall Street since the crash , companies have kept smaller share stockpiles on hand . 
Mr. <unk> of <unk> & <unk> said 0 some prices fell without trades taking place , as market makers kept * dropping the prices at which they would buy shares *T* . 
`` Everyone was hitting everyone else 's bid , '' he said *T* . 
So , while OTC companies incurred losses on Friday , trading officials said 0 the damage was n't as bad as it was *?* in 1987 . 
`` Two years ago we were carrying huge inventories and that was the big <unk> . 
I do n't know of anyone carrying big inventories now , '' said *T* Mr. King of <unk> . 
Tony <unk> , head of equity trading at Piper , <unk> & <unk> in Minneapolis , said that Piper <unk> actually made money on Friday . 
It <unk> helped that his inventory is a third smaller <unk> now than it was *?* two years ago , he said 0 *T* . 
Joseph <unk> , president of the National Association of Securities Dealers , which *T* oversees the Nasdaq computerized trading system , said that despite the rush of selling , he never considered the situation an `` emergency . '' 
`` The pace of trading was orderly , '' he said *T* . 
Nasdaq 's Small <unk> <unk> System `` worked <unk> , '' as did the automated system for larger trades *?* , according to Mr. <unk> . 
Nevertheless , the shock of another steep plunge in stock prices undoubtedly will shake many investors ' confidence . 
In the past , the OTC market <unk> on a firm base of <unk> participation . 
Because Nasdaq 's trading volume has n't returned to <unk> levels , traders and OTC market officials hope 0 the damage <unk> n't be permanent . 
But they are worried . 
`` We were just starting * to get the public 's confidence back , '' <unk> *T* Mr. <unk> of Dean Witter . 
More <unk> is *T* the prospect that the overall collapse in stock prices could permanently <unk> the base of <unk> support 0 the OTC market was struggling * to rebuild *T* in the wake of the October 1987 crash . 
Mr. <unk> of Piper <unk> says 0 some action from government policy makers would <unk> investor fears . 
It <unk> <unk> n't take much more * to `` scare the hell out of retail investors , '' he says 0 *T* . 
The sellers <unk> on Friday came from all <unk> of the OTC market -- big and small institutional investors , as well as individual investors and market makers . 
But <unk> traders said 0 the sell orders generally ranged from 20,000 shares to 50,000 shares , compared with blocks of 500,000 shares or more two years ago . 
Shearson 's Mr. <unk> said 0 retail investors <unk> sold stock Friday and never returned * to <unk> . 
Institutional investors , which *T* had been selling stock throughout last week * to lock in handsome gains made * through the third quarter , were <unk> . 
`` We had a good amount of selling from institutions , but not as much panic , '' Mr. <unk> said *T* . 
`` If they could n't sell , some of them put the shares back on the shelf . '' 
In addition , he said 0 *T* , some bigger institutional investors placed bids * to buy some OTC stocks whose prices *T* were beaten down * . 
In addition , Mr. <unk> said 0 <unk> program selling of OTC stocks in the Russell Index of 2000 small stocks and the Standard & Poor 's 500-stock Index sent occasional `` waves `` through the market . 
Nasdaq 's biggest stocks were <unk> * . 
The Nasdaq 100 Index of the largest <unk> issues , including the big OTC technology issues , tumbled 4.2 % , or <unk> , to <unk> . 
The Nasdaq Financial Index of giant insurance and banking stocks dropped 2 % , or <unk> , to <unk> . 
The OTC market has only a handful of <unk> stocks . 
But they fell sharply . 
McCaw Cellular Communications , for instance , has offered * to buy LIN Broadcasting as well as <unk> 's New York City cellular telephone interests , and in a separate transaction , sell certain McCaw properties to <unk> Cellular . 
McCaw lost 8 % , or 3 <unk> , to 40 . 
LIN Broadcasting , dropped 5 <unk> , or 5 % , to 107 <unk> . 
The turnover in both issues was roughly normal . 
On a day when negative <unk> news did n't sit well with investors *T* , Commercial <unk> , a maker of engineered metal parts , said 0 Haas & Partners advised it that it does n't plan * to pursue its previously reported $ <unk> *U* bid * to buy the company . 
Commercial <unk> plummeted 6 to 26 . 
The issues of companies with ties to the junk bond market also tumbled Friday . 
On the OTC market , First Executive , a big buyer of the high-risk , high-yield issues , slid 2 to 12 <unk> . 
Among other OTC issues , Intel , dropped 2 <unk> to 33 <unk> ; <unk> Transportation lost 1 <unk> to 19 <unk> ; the American depositary receipts of Jaguar were off <unk> to 10 <unk> ; MCI Communications slipped 2 <unk> to 43 <unk> ; Apple Computer fell 3 to 45 <unk> and <unk> dropped 2 <unk> to 66 <unk> .

Pension funds , insurers and other <unk> of the investing world said 0 they began * <unk> up stocks during Friday 's market <unk> . 
And they plan * to buy more today . 
<unk> or <unk> , many giant institutional investors appear * to be fighting the latest war by * applying the lesson 0 they learned *T* in the October 1987 crash : * <unk> at the bottom pays off . 
* To be sure , big investors might put away their <unk> in a <unk> if stocks open sharply lower today . 
They could still panic and bail out of the market . 
But their 1987 performance indicates that they <unk> n't abandon stocks unless conditions get far worse . 
`` Last time , we got <unk> * for * going out and buying stocks when the panic was the worst *T* , '' said *T* John W. Rogers , president of Chicago-based <unk> Capital Management Inc. , which *T* manages $ 1.1 billion *U* of stocks . 
Mr. Rogers spent half his cash on hand Friday for `` our favorite stocks that *T* have fallen apart . '' 
He expects * to invest the rest if the market <unk> further . 
Denver-based portfolio manager James Craig was n't <unk> * when Friday 's <unk> <unk> $ 40 million *U* from the value of the $ <unk> million *U* <unk> Fund 0 he oversees *T* *T* . 
`` I waited * to make sure 0 all the program trades had <unk> through , '' he said *T* . 
Then he jumped into the market : 
`` I spent $ 30 million *U* in the last half-hour . '' 
Other money managers also opened their <unk> . 
`` I was buying at the close -LRB- Friday -RRB- and I 'll be buying again because I know 0 we 're getting good value , '' said *T* Frederick A. <unk> , president of <unk> Asset Management Inc. , Greenwich , <unk> . 
`` There is no <unk> <unk> on the fundamental level for this crash . '' 
Unlike mutual funds , which *T* can be forced * to sell <unk> when investors rush * to withdraw money *T* , big investors such as pension funds and insurance companies can decide * to ride out market <unk> without * <unk> stock . 
Most often , they do just that , because stocks have proved * to be the <unk> long-term investment , * attracting about $ 1 trillion *U* from pension funds alone . 
`` If you bought after the crash , you did very very well off the bottom , '' said *T* Stephen B. <unk> , chief investment officer of Chicago-based Kemper Financial Services <unk> . 
The $ 56 billion *U* California Public Employees Retirement System , for one , added $ 1 billion *U* to its stock portfolio two years ago . 
`` The last crash taught institutional investors that they have * to be long-term holders , and that they <unk> n't react to short-term events , good or bad , '' said *T* Stephen L. <unk> , senior vice president for the pension consultants <unk> Associates in Santa Monica , <unk> . 
`` Those that *T* pulled out -LRB- of stocks -RRB- <unk> it , '' he said *T* , `` so I doubt 0 you 'll see any significant changes '' in institutional portfolios as a result of Friday 's decline . 
Stocks , as * measured * by the Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index , have been <unk> performers this year , * rising <unk> % before Friday 's plunge , excluding dividends . 
Even Friday 's slump leaves investors ahead more than 20 % , well above the annual average for stocks over several decades . 
`` You could go down 400 points and still have a good year in the market , '' said *T* James D. <unk> , president of New York-based <unk> Capital <unk> . 
Mr. <unk> , however , worries that the market `` could go down 800 or 900 points in the next few days . 
It can happen before you can turn around . '' 
He said 0 he <unk> many <unk> with 1987 , including the emphasis on takeover stocks and the <unk> of computerized program trading . 
`` The only thing 0 you do n't have *T* , '' he said *T* , `` is the <unk> portfolio insurance ' phenomenon <unk> * on the rest . '' 
Most institutional investors have abandoned the portfolio insurance hedging technique , which *T* is widely thought * to have <unk> the 1987 crash . 
* Not really insurance , this tactic was designed * to <unk> the blow of declining stock prices and generate an offsetting profit by * selling waves of S&P futures contracts . 
In its <unk> test , the $ 60 billion *U* of portfolio insurance in effect in the 1987 crash did n't work , as stock buyers disappeared and stock and futures prices became <unk> . 
Even without portfolio insurance , market conditions were <unk> Friday , money managers said 0 *T* . 
Neil <unk> , whose New York-based <unk> Capital Partners *T* had converted 85 % of its $ 220 million *U* investment pool to cash in recent months , said 0 he was <unk> * by Wall Street firms <unk> Friday asking him * to take stock off their hands . 
`` We got calls from big block houses asking us if we want * to make bids on anything , '' said *T* Mr. <unk> , who , * happy with his returns on investments <unk> * up earlier , *T* declined the offers . 
Mr. <unk> predicts 0 stocks will appear * to stabilize in the next few days before * declining again , * <unk> more investors . 
`` I think 0 it will be a <unk> <unk> rally , '' he said *T* . 
Meanwhile , Friday brought a <unk> for money managers whose investment styles *T* had put them at odds with the market rally .

The <unk> sell borrowed shares , * hoping * to profit by * replacing them later at a lower price . 
The nation 's largest <unk> operation is <unk> Brothers , Palo Alto , Calif. , which *T* said last May that its short positions had shown losses of 10 % for the year up to that point . 
All that now has changed . 
`` We 're ahead for the year because of Friday , '' said *T* the firm 's <unk> <unk> . 
`` We 're not making a killing , but we had a good day . 
Food and Drug Administration spokesman Jeff <unk> said 0 the agency has turned over evidence in a criminal investigation concerning <unk> Pharmaceuticals Inc. to the U.S. Attorney 's office in Baltimore . 
Neither <unk> nor any of the <unk> <unk> , N.Y. , company 's officials or employees have been charged * with any crimes . 
<unk> won approval * to market a version of a blood pressure medicine but acknowledged that it <unk> a SmithKline <unk> PLC product as its own in tests . 
Mr. <unk> also said 0 the FDA has asked Bolar Pharmaceutical Co. * to recall at the retail level its <unk> <unk> <unk> . 
But so far the company has n't <unk> with that request , the spokesman said 0 *T* . 
Bolar , the subject of a criminal investigation by the FDA and the <unk> General 's office of the Health and Human Services Department , only agreed * to recall two <unk> of its version of <unk> `` as far down as direct customers , mostly <unk> , '' Mr. <unk> said 0 *T* . 
Bolar , of <unk> , N.Y. , earlier began a voluntary recall of both its 100 <unk> and 50 <unk> versions of the drug . 
The FDA has said 0 it presented evidence 0 it uncovered *T* <unk> to the company indicating that Bolar <unk> the <unk> product for its own * to gain government approval * to sell generic versions of <unk> . 
Bolar has denied that it switched the <unk> product for its own in such testing . 
The West German retailer <unk> Deutsche <unk> AG plans * to challenge the <unk> of a widely employed anti-takeover defense of companies in the Netherlands . 
The eventual court decision could become a landmark in Dutch corporate law because the lawsuit 0 <unk> plans * to file *T* would be the first 0 *T* to challenge the entire principle and practice of companies issuing voting preferred shares to <unk> trusts * to dilute voting power of common stockholders . 
Up to now only specific aspects of these defenses have been challenged * , though unsuccessfully , <unk> 's Dutch lawyers noted 0 *T* . 
Should the courts <unk> the <unk> of this type of defense , <unk> will then ask the court * to overturn such a <unk> maneuver recently <unk> * by <unk> <unk> <unk> . 
<unk> says 0 the <unk> international food retailer had n't reasonable grounds 0 * to issue preferred stock to a friendly trust *T* and thus dilute the worth and voting power of <unk> and other shareholders . 
* Speaking through its Dutch lawyers , <unk> also disclosed 0 it holds a 15 % stake in <unk> . 
It <unk> was previously thought * 0 <unk> held a 13.6 % stake that *T* was accumulated * since July . 
A spokesman for <unk> said 0 his company is confident of its own position and the <unk> of the <unk> issue . 
He termed <unk> 's legal actions as `` <unk> '' to international cooperation among European retailers . 
Chase Manhattan Bank Chairman <unk> <unk> is a conservative banker and a loyal Republican , but on Friday morning he had few kind words for President Bush 's economic policy-making . 
`` There are some very significant issues out there , such as the fiscal deficit , the trade deficit , our relations with Japan , that *T* have * to be the subject of major initiatives , '' he said *T* in an interview . 
`` I 'd like * to see that initiative , and I have n't *?* . 
There is n't a big shot , an agenda . '' 
A few hours later , the stock market dropped 190 points . 
<unk> tried * to <unk> each other for the blame , although many analysts doubt that Washington was <unk> responsible for Wall Street 's woes . 
But Mr. <unk> 's comments make one thing <unk> clear : Some on Wall Street wonder if anyone is in charge of economic policy . 
* Consider this : 
-- By <unk> p.m. tonight , President Bush must order $ 16 billion *U* of automatic , across-the-board cuts in government spending * to comply with the Gramm-Rudman budget law . 
The cuts are necessary because Congress and the administration have failed * to reach agreement on a <unk> bill . 
`` We simply do n't have strong leadership 0 *T* to try * to reduce the deficit and make tough choices , '' House Budget Committee Chairman Leon <unk> -LRB- D. , <unk> . -RRB- said *T* yesterday on NBC News 's `` * <unk> the Press . '' 
-- For the last two weeks , the Bush administration and the Federal Reserve have been engaged * in a <unk> battle over international economic policy . 
The administration has been trying * to push the dollar lower ; the Fed has been <unk> . 
`` One of the things that *T* continues * to worry me is this monetary warfare between the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Board , '' said *T* Lawrence <unk> , a Bear , Stearns & Co. economist , on ABC 's `` This Week . '' 
-- The administration has sent out confusing signals about its response to a recent spate of airline takeovers . 
Last month , Transportation Secretary Sam <unk> forced Northwest Airlines to reduce a stake held * by <unk> Royal Dutch Airlines . 
But he has since run into opposition from the Treasury and the White House over that decision . 
And he has kept <unk> on how his decision might affect a bid for United Airlines , which *T* includes a big stake by British Airways PLC *T* . 
Some analysts say 0 uncertainty about Washington 's anti-takeover policy was one reason that financing for the United Airlines takeover fell through *T* -- the event that *T* triggered the market drop . 
In many ways , the <unk> to Friday 's stock decline is <unk> similar to that of October 1987 's <unk> crash . 
Then , as now , the budget debate was behind schedule and automatic spending cuts were within days of * taking hold . 
The Treasury was locked * in a battle over international economic policy , although at that time it was with West German officials rather than the Federal Reserve . 
And concern about official actions aimed * at takeovers -- then by the <unk> House Ways and Means Committee rather than the Transportation Department -- were making markets nervous . 
The 1987 crash brought the Reagan administration and Democratic lawmakers to the table for the first budget summit , * resulting in a two-year plan * to reduce the deficit by more than $ 76 billion *U* -- even though the deficit actually rose by nearly $ 12 billion *U* during that period . 
But , barring further drops in the market this week , a similar outcome does n't seem likely this year . 
Lawmakers and administration officials agree that Friday 's drop , by itself , is n't enough * to force both sides back to the table * to try * to reach a deficit-reduction agreement that *T* would be more serious and more <unk> than last spring 's <unk> plan , which *T* still is n't fully implemented * . 
One of the biggest reasons that new talks are n't likely * to come about *T* is that , as everyone learned in 1987 , the economy and the market can survive a one-day <unk> tumble . 
`` Everybody thought 0 we were looking at a <unk> of 1929 , that we were looking at a recession , '' Rep. <unk> said *T* yesterday in an interview . 
`` That did not happen . 
They learned 0 they could survive it without much problem . '' 
But administration officials privately agree with Mr. <unk> , who *T* said 0 a <unk> drop this week `` is going * to force the president and Congress to take a much harder look at fiscal policy . '' 
In that case , there will be plenty of blame 0 *T* to go around . 
`` There is an underlying concern <unk> on the part of the American people -- and there should be *?* - that the administration has not gone far enough in * cutting this deficit and that Congress has been unwilling * to cut what the administration asked us * to cut *T* , '' said *T* Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen -LRB- D. , Texas -RRB- . 
Nevertheless , it clearly will take more than Friday 's <unk> decline * to overcome the bitter feelings that *T* have developed between lawmakers and White House Budget Director Richard <unk> over the capital-gains fight . 
Hill Democrats are particularly angry over Mr. Bush 's claim that the capital-gains cut was part of April 's budget accord and his insistence on * combining it with the deficit-reduction legislation . 
`` There is no prospect of any so-called grand compromise or deal next year because the administration simply did n't live up to this year 's deal , '' Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell -LRB- D. , Maine -RRB- said *T* yesterday on CBS News 's `` * <unk> the <unk> . '' 
During last week 's <unk> on the <unk> bill and the capital-gains issue , there were signs that Senate Republicans and the administration were at odds . 
At the very moment that Senate Republicans were negotiating a deal 0 *T* to exclude capital gains from the deficit-reduction legislation *T* , White House spokesman <unk> Fitzwater told reporters that it <unk> was the president 's policy * to include it . 
When an agreement <unk> was reached * * to strip capital gains from the legislation *T* , Oregon Sen. Bob <unk> , the ranking GOP member of the <unk> Senate Finance Committee , hailed it . 
* Asked * if the administration agreed , he <unk> replied : 0 `` The <unk> will have * to speak for itself . '' 
Friday 's market tumble could spur action on * <unk> the House and Senate versions of the deficit-reduction measure , a process that *T* is n't expected * to begin until tomorrow at the <unk> . 
Senate Republicans expressed the hope that the House would follow the lead of the Senate , which *T* on Friday agreed * to drop a variety of spending measures and tax breaks that *T* would have increased the fiscal 1990 deficit . 
`` The market needs a strong signal that we 're serious about deficit reduction , and the best way 0 * to do that *T* is for the House of Representatives to strip their bill '' of similar provisions , Sen. Warren <unk> -LRB- R. , <unk> . -RRB- . said 0 *T* yesterday . 
The White House Office of Management and Budget , whose calculations *T* determine whether the Gramm-Rudman targets are met * , estimated that the <unk> deficit-reduction measure would cut the fiscal 1990 shortfall by $ 6.2 billion *U* , almost half of the Congressional Budget Office 's estimate of $ <unk> billion *U* . 
Rep. <unk> said that <unk> 's figure would still be enough * to avoid permanent across-the-board cuts , but added : 0 `` We 're getting very close to the margins here . '' 
No one in Washington was willing * to take the blame for * <unk> Friday 's drop in the stock market . 
But some players were quick * to seize the moment . 
Before the sun had set on Friday , Richard <unk> , the <unk> chief economist of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , issued a statement <unk> the drop in stock prices to the Senate decision * to postpone action on capital gains . 
`` Investors , who *T* had been holding assets in anticipation of a more favorable time 0 * to sell *T* , were <unk> * , '' he said *T* . 
`` There have been many <unk> reasons <unk> advanced * * to support a capital-gains tax cut , '' Sen. Mitchell said *T* during his television appearance , `` but I suggest 0 that is perhaps more than any of the others .

Small investors matched their big institutional <unk> in anxiety over the weekend , but most seemed * to be taking a <unk> approach and said 0 they were resigned * to * riding out the latest storm in the stock market . 
`` I 'm not losing faith in the market , '' said *T* Boston lawyer Christopher Sullivan as he watched the market plunge on a big screen in front of a brokerage firm . 
But he 's not so sure about everyone else . 
`` I think 0 on Monday the small -LRB- investors -RRB- are going * to panic and sell , '' predicted *T* Mr. Sullivan , whose investments *T* include AMR Corp. 's American Airlines unit and several mutual funds . 
`` And I think 0 institutions are going * to come in and buy <unk> 
I 'm going * to hold on . 
If I sell now , I 'll take a big loss . '' 
Some <unk> an optimism that *T* had been <unk> * when they did n't <unk> the market in 1987 *T* . 
`` Oh , I bet 0 it 'll be up 50 points on Monday , '' said *T* <unk> <unk> , a <unk> retired <unk> in Lexington , <unk> . 
Mrs. <unk> said 0 her <unk> Investment Club 's portfolio lost about one-third of its value following the Black Monday crash , `` but no one got discouraged * , and we gained that back -- and more . '' 
At the annual <unk> of the National Association of Investors Corp. at the <unk> <unk> hotel in Minneapolis , the scene was calm . 
Some 500 investors representing investor clubs from around the U.S. were attending when the market started * to slide Friday *T* . 
But Robert <unk> , an official of the association , said 0 no special <unk> or emergency meetings of the investors ' clubs are planned * . 
In fact , some of the association 's members -- long-term , <unk> investors -- welcomed the drop in prices . 
`` We hope * to take advantage of it , '' said *T* John Snyder , a member of a Los Angeles investors ' club . 
He has four stocks <unk> in mind 0 * to buy *T* if the prices drop to the level 0 he wants *T* . 
Not everyone is <unk> so <unk> , however , and many wonder about the long-term implications of what *T* is widely viewed * as the cause of Friday 's slide , reluctance <unk> by banks * to provide financing for a buy-out of UAL Corp. , parent of United Airlines . 
Marc <unk> , a Tampa , Fla. , investment banker , said 0 the market drop is one of `` a tremendous number of signs that the leveraged <unk> era is ending . 
There 's no question that there 's a general <unk> for leverage among lenders . 
'' Mr. <unk> believes , however , that the market could be <unk> * if California investor Marvin Davis steps back in to the United bidding with an offer of $ 275 *U* a share . 
Sara Albert , a <unk> Dallas law student , says 0 she 's generally <unk> about the stock market and the takeover activity that *T* seems * to fuel it . 
`` I have this feeling that it 's built * on <unk> , '' she says 0 *T* , that the market rises `` but there 's no foundation to it . '' 
She and her husband pulled most of their investments out of the market after the 1987 crash , although she still owns some Texaco stock . 
<unk> because of concern about the economy and partly because she recently quit her job as a legal assistant * to go to school , `` I think at this point 0 we want * to be a lot more liquid . '' 
Others wonder how many more of these <unk> the small investor can stand *T* . 
`` We all assumed 0 October <unk> was a one-time shot , '' said *T* San Francisco attorney David Greenberg . 
`` We told the little guy 0 it could only happen once in a lifetime , * come on back . 
Now it 's happening again . '' 
Mr. Greenberg got out just before the 1987 crash and , to his <unk> , never went back even as the market soared . 
This time he 's ready * to buy in `` when the panic wears off . '' 
Still , he adds : `` We <unk> n't have this kind of thing happen very often . 
When the little guy gets <unk> *T* , the big guys hurt badly . 
Merrill Lynch <unk> n't survive without the little guy . '' 
Small investors have <unk> back into the market following Black Monday , but mostly through mutual funds . 
<unk> brokerage customers `` have been in the market somewhat but not whole hog like they were *?* two years ago , '' says 0 *T* Leslie <unk> Jr. , chairman of the <unk> & <unk> discount brokerage firm .

Individual investors are still angry about program trading , Mr. <unk> says 0 *T* . 
<unk> <unk> , a <unk> University finance professor , says 0 government regulators will have * to more closely control program trading * to `` win back the confidence of the small investor . '' 
But it 's not only the stock market that *T* has some small investors worried * . 
Alan <unk> , general sales manager of a Chrysler <unk> in Houston , said 0 he and his mother have some joint stock investments , but the overall economy is his chief worry . 
`` These high <unk> took a big <unk> today , '' he said *T* in his <unk> , which *T* is within a few miles of the <unk> dollar homes of some of Houston 's <unk> citizens . 
`` And I can tell you that a high <unk> is n't going * to come in tomorrow and buy a Chrysler <unk> by <unk> . '' 
And , finally , there were the <unk> . 
`` I got out in 1987 . 
Everything , '' said *T* <unk> <unk> , an Akron , Ohio , <unk> contractor who *T* was visiting Chicago and stopped by Fidelity Investments ' <unk> Street office . 
`` I just stopped by * to see how much I would have lost *T* . '' 
Would Mr. <unk> ever get back in ? 
`` Are you <unk> ! 
When it comes to money *T* : Once * <unk> * , * 2,000 times shy . 
The crowded field for <unk> computers is about * to become a lot more crowded . 
Compaq Computer Corp. 's long-awaited entry today into the <unk> field is expected * to put immediate heat on others in the market , especially Zenith Electronics Corp. , the current market leader , and on a <unk> of promising <unk> . 
Compaq 's series of <unk> extends a trend toward <unk> in the personal computer market . 
One manufacturer already has produced a <unk> computer called * a <unk> , and two others have introduced even smaller `` <unk> . '' 
But those machines are still considered * <unk> , with <unk> 0 only a <unk> could love *T* and screens 0 *T* to match . 
Compaq 's <unk> , by contrast , may be the first in their weight class not to <unk> on features found * in much bigger machines . 
Analysts say 0 they 're faster and carry more memory than anything else of their size on the market -- and they 're priced * aggressively at $ <unk> *U* to $ 5,000 *U* . 
All of this comes in a machine that *T* <unk> only six pounds and fits <unk> into most <unk> . 
In recent months , Compaq 's competition , including Zenith , Toshiba Corp. , Tandy Corp. and NEC Corp. all have introduced <unk> that *T* weigh approximately the same and that *T* are called * <unk> -- perhaps <unk> . 
One analyst , * noting that most such machines are about two inches thick , takes exception to the name . 
`` This is n't quite a <unk> -- I call it a <unk> , '' he says *T* . 
That <unk> n't be said * of the $ <unk> *U* <unk> computer introduced * a few weeks ago by <unk> Systems Corp. , a unit of Tandy . 
Instead of a <unk> , it features a writing surface , an electronic <unk> and the ability * to `` read '' block printing . 
At 4 <unk> pounds , it may be too <unk> named * , but it nevertheless opens up the kind of marketing possibilities that *T* make analysts <unk> . 
<unk> are n't far behind . 
<unk> Corp. 's <unk> , * introduced * in Europe two months ago and in the U.S. in early September , <unk> less than a pound , costs a mere $ 400 *U* and runs on three <unk> batteries , yet has the power * to run some <unk> and word processing programs . 
Some critics , however , say its ability * to run <unk> programs is restricted * by a limited memory . 
<unk> Computer Corp. , meanwhile , has introduced a much more sophisticated <unk> that *T* can run Lotus 1-2-3 and other sophisticated software programs , but costs five times as much . 
At stake is *T* what Mike <unk> , Compaq 's president of North America operations , calls *T* `` the <unk> <unk> of the computer industry '' -- the search for `` a real computer in a package so small 0 you can take it everywhere . '' 
The market is so new , 0 nobody knows yet how big it can be *T* . 
`` I 've had a lot of people trying * to sell me services 0 *T* to find out how big it is *T* , '' says *T* Tom <unk> , director of marketing for <unk> . 
`` Whether it 's $ 5 billion *U* or $ 3.5 billion *U* , it does n't matter . 
It 's huge . '' 
* Consider the growth of <unk> , which *T* now <unk> 12 % of all personal computer sales . 
<unk> -- generally anything under 15 pounds -- have become the fastest-growing personal computer segment , with sales doubling this year . 
* <unk> to that demand , however , has led to a variety of <unk> . 
* <unk> computers smaller often means * <unk> memory . 
It also has <unk> use of the faster , more powerful <unk> found * in increasing numbers of desktop machines . 
<unk> and weight considerations also have limited screen displays . 
The competitive <unk> can get pretty <unk> at times . 
A <unk> spokesman , for example , <unk> the <unk> <unk> because it requires three batteries while the <unk> needs only two . 
Both <unk> are dismissed * by <unk> makers , who *T* argue that they 're too small -- a problem 0 <unk> also encountered *T* in focus groups , admits 0 *T* <unk> <unk> , director of marketing . 
<unk> , * trying * to avoid the `` <unk> '' label , responded with the tag line , `` The <unk> PC -- a <unk> Big Computer . '' 
Despite the <unk> , few question the <unk> of the move to small machines that *T* do n't make <unk> . 
<unk> that end , experts say 0 the real battle will take place between <unk> players like Toshiba , Zenith and now Compaq . 
Compaq 's new machines are considered * a direct threat to start-up firms like <unk> Inc. , which *T* introduced in June a computer that , like Compaq 's , *T* uses an Intel <unk> microprocessor and has a hard disk drive . 
But the <unk> product is twice as heavy and costs more than Compaq 's . 
Compaq 's announcement also <unk> trouble for Zenith , which *T* last year had 28 % of the U.S. <unk> market but recently agreed * to sell its computer business to Cie. des Machines <unk> , the French government-owned computer maker . 
Zenith holders will vote in December on the proposed $ <unk> million *U* sale , a price that *T* could slip because it is <unk> * to Zenith 's share and sales . 
Compaq is already taking aim at Zenith 's market share . 
<unk> <unk> , Compaq 's president and chief executive officer , notes <unk> that Zenith 's $ 2,000 *U* <unk> uses an `` <unk> '' <unk> <unk> disk , <unk> Compaq 's new machines use the more common 3 <unk> disk . 
John P. Frank , president of Zenith Data Systems , simply <unk> off such criticism , * noting that 3 <unk> <unk> were also `` <unk> '' when they first replaced <unk> disks *T* . 
`` We do n't look at it as * not being a standard , we look at it as a new standard , '' he argues *T* . 
Analysts do n't see it that way . 
`` I <unk> n't imagine that you 'll talk to anyone who *T* <unk> n't tell you 0 this is <unk> for Compaq and a <unk> for everyone else , '' says *T* Gene <unk> , president of Professional Marketing Management <unk> . 
Adds <unk> Bill <unk> , senior industry analyst for <unk> , a high-technology market research firm : `` We basically think that these are very hot products . 
The problem 0 Compaq is going * to have *T* is that they <unk> n't be able * to make enough of them . '' 
Compaq 's machines include the 3 <unk> <unk> disk drive , a <unk> screen that *T* is only <unk> thick and an internal expansion <unk> for a <unk> -- in other words , almost all the capabilities of a typical office machine . 
Others undoubtedly will follow , but most analysts believe 0 Compaq has at least a six-month lead on the competition . 
Toshiba 's line of <unk> , for example , features the <unk> , which *T* is in the same weight class but is much slower and has less memory , and the <unk> , which *T* also uses a <unk> microprocessor , but which *T* <unk> almost twice as much and is three times the size . 
A third model , * marketed * in Japan , may hit the U.S. by the end of the first quarter of 1990 , but by then , analysts say 0 *T* , Compaq will have established itself as one of three major players . 
What about Big Blue ? 
International Business Machines Corp. , analysts say 0 *T* , has been burned * twice in * trying * to enter the <unk> market and shows no signs of * trying * to get into <unk> anytime soon . 
Honeywell Inc. and International Business Machines Corp. received Air Force contracts 0 *T* to develop integrated circuits for use in space . 
Honeywell 's contract totaled $ <unk> million *U* , and IBM 's $ <unk> million *U* . 
Boeing Co. received a $ <unk> million *U* Air Force contract for * developing cable systems for the <unk> <unk> . 
General Dynamics Corp. received a $ 29 million *U* Air Force contract for <unk> training sets . 
Grumman Corp. received an $ <unk> million *U* Navy contract 0 *T* to upgrade aircraft electronics . 
<unk> Corp. received an $ <unk> million *U* Army contract for helicopter engines . 
Sharp increases in the price of fresh produce caused Spain 's September consumer price index to shoot up 1.1 % from the previous month , * pushing the annual rate of inflation to 6.8 % , the National Institute of Statistics said 0 *T* Friday . 
The monthly increase is the highest recorded * in the past four years . 
The index , which *T* registered <unk> at the end of September , has a base of 100 set * in 1983 and is n't seasonally adjusted * . 
Prices have risen 5.9 % in the first nine months of the year , * <unk> both the initial 3 % inflation goal set * by the government of Socialist Prime Minister <unk> <unk> and the second , revised goal of 5.8 % . 
Japan 's wholesale prices in September rose 3.3 % from a year earlier and were up 0.4 % from the previous month , the Bank of Japan announced 0 *T* Friday . 
The wholesale price index stood at <unk> , compared with a 1985 base of 100 . 
<unk> ? 
What plunge ? 
<unk> New York Stock Exchange issues hit 52-week highs during Friday 's trading , despite the Dow Jones Industrial Average 's <unk> plunge . 
Stocks of utilities held up relatively better than other market sectors during the sell-off . 
And among the issues hitting new highs were *T* Detroit Edison Co. and <unk> <unk> Power <unk> . 
Other major issues hitting highs included American Telephone & Telegraph Co. , Westinghouse Electric Corp. , Exxon Corp. and <unk> Corp. , the big insurer . 
Of course , many more issues -- 93 -- hit new lows . 
These included International Business Machines Corp. , which *T* during Friday 's session traded below $ 100 *U* a share for the first time since June 1984 . 
IBM closed at $ 102 *U* , down $ <unk> *U* . 
Other new lows included <unk> International Corp. , Union Carbide Corp. and Bethlehem Steel Corp. , all of which *T* are included * in the industrial average . 
Meanwhile , two initial public offerings <unk> the <unk> market in their <unk> day of national over-the-counter trading Friday . 
Shares of <unk> 's Inc. , an operator of fast-food restaurants , closed at $ 17 *U* each , up from its $ 15 *U* offering price and shares of <unk> <unk> Plans Inc. , a health-care consultant , closed at $ <unk> *U* , up from its $ 12 *U* offering price . 
Ford Motor Co. said 0 it acquired 5 % of the shares in Jaguar PLC . 
Jaguar , the London Stock Exchange and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are being notified * of the transactions , the company said 0 *T* . 
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission advised Ford last week that it would n't raise any <unk> to the acquisition of as much as 15 % of Jaguar shares . 
The No. 2 auto maker disclosed last month that it wants * to buy as much as 15 % of the British <unk> maker , the maximum allowed * under current United Kingdom government restrictions . 
General Motors Corp. said 0 it had discussed the possibility of a joint venture with Jaguar before Ford began * buying shares . 
GM said 0 it still is talking with Jaguar about * acquiring a minority interest . 
Investors who *T* bought stock with borrowed money -- that is , `` on margin '' -- may be more worried than most following Friday 's market drop . 
That 's because their brokers can require them to sell some shares or put up more cash 0 *T* to enhance the collateral backing their loans . 
In October 1987 , these margin calls were thought * to have contributed to the downward <unk> of the stock market . 
Typically , a margin call occurs when the price of a stock falls below 75 % of its original value *T* . 
If the investor does n't put up the extra cash 0 *T* to satisfy the call , the brokerage firm may begin * liquidating the securities . 
But some big brokerage firms said 0 they do n't expect major problems as a result of margin calls . 
<unk> calls since Friday `` have been higher than usual , but reasonable , '' a spokesman for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said 0 *T* . 
Merrill Lynch & Co. officials `` do n't expect -LCB- margin calls -RCB- to be as big a factor as in 1987 '' because fewer individual investors are buying stock on margin , a spokesman said 0 *T* . 
<unk> <unk> , senior vice president at Charles Schwab Corp. , the San Francisco-based discount brokerage firm , said 0 he did n't expect any immediate problems with margin calls for Schwab customers . 
He said 0 Schwab had increased margin requirements `` so customers have more of a <unk> . '' 
He added : `` We learned a lesson <unk> in 1987 about volatility . 
<unk> Inc. , * following rival Hertz Corp. 's lead , said 0 it is backing out of <unk> programs with three airlines . 
The Garden City , N.Y. , <unk> company said 0 it <unk> n't renew contracts with NWA Inc. 's Northwest Airlines unit , Pan Am Corp. 's Pan American World Airways unit and Midway Airlines at the end of this year . 
But it remains involved in programs with AMR Corp. 's American Airlines unit and Delta Air Lines . 
Industry estimates put <unk> 's annual cost of all five programs at between $ 8 million and $ 14 million *U* . 
A spokesman for <unk> would n't specify the costs but said 0 the three airlines being dropped * account for `` far less than half '' of the total . 
Budget <unk> a Car Corp. , of Chicago , and National Car <unk> Systems Inc. , of Minneapolis , both said 0 they had no plans * to follow suit . 
In fact , Budget indicated 0 it saw some benefit to * staying involved in these programs , in which <unk> earn <unk> miles *T* and <unk> can get <unk> discounts *T* . 
`` I can not see how this news by Hertz and <unk> can not benefit Budget 's programs , '' said *T* Bob Wilson , Budget 's vice president , marketing planning . 
Northwest and Midway are two of the five airlines with which Budget has agreements *T* . 
National also <unk> in the Northwest <unk> program along with four other airlines , including Delta and USAir Group Inc. 's USAir unit . 
A month ago , Hertz , of Park <unk> , N.J. , said that it would drop its marketing agreements <unk> at year end with Delta , America West and Texas Air Corp. 's Continental Airlines and Eastern Airlines , and that <unk> with American Airlines , UAL <unk> 's United Airlines and USAir also would be ended * <unk> sometime after Dec. 31 . 
At the time , Hertz said 0 its annual fees to those airlines amounted to $ 20 million *U* and that the value of redeemed awards topped $ 15 million *U* . 
Analysts and competitors , however , doubt 0 the numbers were that high . 
Budget said 0 its <unk> costs are `` substantially below '' <unk> 's level . 
Robert D. <unk> , <unk> vice president of marketing , said , 0 `` The <unk> and costs attached * to -LCB- <unk> programs -RCB- have significantly diminished their value . '' 
This year has been difficult for both Hertz and <unk> , said 0 *T* Charles <unk> , <unk> industry analyst at Alex . Brown & Sons . 
`` They 've been looking * to get their costs down , and this is a fairly sensible way 0 * to do it *T* , '' he said *T* . 
CBS Inc. is cutting `` The Pat <unk> Show '' down to one hour from its current 90 minutes . 
CBS insisted 0 the move was n't a setback for the program , which *T* is the network 's first entry into the <unk> talk show format since 1972 . 
`` I have every intention of * making this the best possible show and * having it run one hour is the best way to it , '' said *T* <unk> <unk> , who *T* was named * vice president of late night entertainment in August . 
`` This will raise the energy level of the show . '' 
CBS will continue * to program <unk> shows 0 *T* to follow the <unk> hour . 
But CBS News will extend its <unk> `` <unk> '' by 30 minutes and begin at <unk> <unk> . 
The show , despite a promising start , has slipped badly in the weekly ratings as * compiled * by <unk> Nielsen Co. , * finishing far below `` <unk> '' on NBC , a unit of General Electric Co. , and `` <unk> '' on <unk> , a unit of Capital <unk> <unk> . 
Further <unk> the <unk> audience is *T* the addition of the `` <unk> Hall Show , '' syndicated * by Paramount Communications <unk> . 
<unk> Computers Inc. , * preparing * to fight with International Business Machines Corp. for a piece of the mainframe business , said 0 it expects * to post higher revenue and earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept. 30 . 
<unk> said 0 it expects * to report revenue of about $ 450 million *U* and earnings of 35 cents to 40 cents a share . 
The results , which *T* are in line with analysts ' estimates , reflect `` a continued improvement in our U.S. business , '' said 0 *T* James <unk> , <unk> 's chief executive officer . 
In the year-earlier period , <unk> reported net income of $ <unk> million *U* , or 31 cents a share , on revenue of $ <unk> million *U* . 
<unk> expects * to report the full results for the quarter next week . 
Analysts have predicted that the <unk> , Calif. , company will report revenue of $ <unk> million to $ <unk> million *U* and earnings of 35 cents to 40 cents a share . 
* <unk> on the results for the quarter , Mr. <unk> said 0 the strength of the company 's domestic business came as `` a surprise '' to him , * noting that sales `` in every region of the U.S. exceeded our plan . '' 
The company 's U.S. performance was helped * by `` a record quarter for new customers , '' he said 0 *T* . 
<unk> makes `` <unk> '' computers -- machines with <unk> <unk> systems -- that *T* run stock exchanges , networks of automatic <unk> and other complex computer systems . 
<unk> the company is scheduled * to announce its most powerful computer ever , which *T* for the first time will bring it into direct competition with makers of mainframe computers . 
<unk> 's new <unk> computer is called * <unk> . 
Prices for the machine , which *T* can come in various <unk> , are $ 2 million to $ 10 million *U* . 
Analysts expect the new computer to <unk> a hefty <unk> of business away from IBM , the longtime leader in <unk> . 
`` We believe 0 they could <unk> perhaps two to three billion dollars from IBM '' over the next few years , said 0 *T* George Weiss , an analyst at the Gartner group . 
That will spur <unk> 's growth . 
`` I 'd be disappointed if the company grew by less than 20 % next year , '' said *T* John <unk> , an analyst at Goldman , Sachs & <unk> . 
IBM is expected * to respond to <unk> 's <unk> by * discounting its own <unk> , which analysts say 0 *T* are roughly three times the price of a comparable system from <unk> . 
`` Obviously IBM can give bigger discounts to users immediately , '' said *T* Mr. Weiss . 
But Mr. <unk> questions whether that will be enough * to stop <unk> 's first mainframe from * taking on some of the functions that large organizations previously sought *T* from Big Blue 's machines . 
`` The answer is n't price reductions , but new systems , '' he said *T* . 
Nevertheless , <unk> faces a variety of challenges , the biggest being that customers generally view the company 's computers as <unk> to IBM 's <unk> . 
Even Mr. <unk> is reluctant * to abandon this notion , * insisting that <unk> 's new machines are n't <unk> for IBM 's <unk> . 
`` We 're after a little bigger niche , '' he said *T* . 
* Do n't jump yet . 
The stock market 's <unk> may turn out * to be good news for the economy . 
In one wild hour of trading , the market managed * to accomplish what the Bush administration has been trying * to do *T* , unsuccessfully , for weeks . 
It is forcing the Federal Reserve to ease its grip on credit and it took the wind out of a previously <unk> dollar . 
The resulting decline in interest rates and the value of the dollar could <unk> American business -- indeed , the entire economy . 
This may sound <unk> optimistic . 
After all , until a few years ago , the stock market was viewed * as a barometer of the national economy . 
When it went down *T* , by all tradition , the economy followed . 
That has changed , partly because the two years following the worst stock-market plunge in history have been reasonably comfortable . 
The 1987 crash was `` a false alarm however you view it *T* , '' says 0 *T* University of Chicago economist Victor <unk> . 
The market seems increasingly <unk> from the rest of the nation . 
Its <unk> <unk> n't be <unk> * to fundamental business conditions , nor do they appear * to <unk> major shifts in the economy . 
`` The market today has a life of its own , '' John <unk> , chairman of International Business Machines Corp. , said *T* Saturday . 
`` There 's nothing rational about this kind of action . '' 
Of course , the health of the economy will be threatened * if the market continues * to <unk> this week . 
<unk> falling stock prices do reduce consumer wealth , damage business confidence and discourage the foreign investors upon whom the U.S. now relies *T* for financial <unk> . 
The financial-services industry was battered * by the 1987 crash . 
What *T* 's more , although the stock market is far less <unk> <unk> today than two years ago , the U.S. economy is weaker . 
Growth is slower . 
<unk> are <unk> . 
<unk> burdens are <unk> . 
But if the stock market does n't continue * to <unk> , the beneficial effects of lower interest rates and a lower dollar may well dominate . 
The Fed , which *T* until Friday had been <unk> moves 0 *T* to ease credit , is now poised * to <unk> money into the economy if * needed * * to <unk> the markets . 
Fed officials may protest that this does n't necessarily mean a fundamental change in their interest-rate policies . 
But the experience of the 1987 crash suggests 0 the Fed is likely * to bring down short-term interest rates in its effort * to calm markets . 
* <unk> the Fed 's move , money traders lowered a key interest rate known * as the Federal <unk> rate to <unk> % <unk> late Friday , down from <unk> % the day before . 
<unk> movements in the rate , which *T* is what banks charge each other *T* for overnight loans , are usually among the few visible tracks that the Fed leaves *T* on the monetary markets . 
The dollar also began * to decline Friday as the stock market 's plunge caused some investors to <unk> their desire * to invest in the U.S. . 
Treasury officials have been arguing for months that the dollar 's strength was out of <unk> with economic fundamentals , * threatening * to <unk> the export boom that *T* has sustained manufacturers for several years . 
The market drop has now apparently convinced foreign investors that the Treasury was right about the <unk> dollar . 
A modest drop in the dollar -- only a modest one , * mind you -- would be welcomed * by the U.S. . 
That was n't the case in 1987 , when the dollar was so weak that some economists and government officials seriously worried that it might collapse , * producing panic among foreign investors and <unk> the flow of foreign capital to the U.S. *T* . 
Another big difference between 1987 and 1989 is n't so <unk> . 
In the third quarter of 1987 , the economy <unk> at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of 5.3 % . 
The consensus among economists is that it grew a much more sluggish 2.3 % in the third quarter of 1989 , which *T* ended two weeks ago . 
The plunge in stock prices `` is happening at a time when the economy has already slowed down *T* , '' says 0 *T* economist Lawrence <unk> of <unk> Group , a <unk> <unk> , Pa. , forecasting company . 
`` A lot of <unk> demand is gone . '' 
Consumer spending did drop in the months following Black Monday 1987 -- `` but only slightly and for a short period of time , '' recalls 0 *T* Mr. <unk> , a longtime student of business <unk> . 
`` That was offset * by strength elsewhere . 
-LCB- The effects -RCB- were much less severe and less prolonged than some had feared or expected 0 *?* . 
'' Today , he <unk> *T* , exports and business investment spending may be insufficient * to pick up the <unk> if stock prices <unk> this week and if consumers <unk> in reaction . 
What *T* 's more , the corporate borrowing <unk> has n't <unk> in the past two years . 
`` We 've had two more years of significant <unk> of debt <unk> just at the time when earnings are being squeezed * *T* , '' Mr. <unk> notes *T* . 
The more a company relies on borrowed money , the greater its <unk> to an economic slowdown . 
A company with a strong balance sheet can <unk> an <unk> storm ; a highly leveraged company may end up in bankruptcy court . 
The Fed , of course , knows that very well -- <unk> its <unk> * to pump credit into the economy this morning . 
But , in the process , the Fed risks * <unk> inflation . 
Even before Friday 's events , Harvard University economist Benjamin Friedman was arguing that the Fed <unk> n't be able * to live up to its tough words on * eliminating inflation because of its responsibility * to protect fragile financial markets , banks and highly leveraged corporations . 
The biggest threat on the economic horizon right now is n't recession , he reasons 0 *T* ; it 's an <unk> of <unk> inflation . 
In the end , the 1987 collapse suggested 0 *T* , the economy does n't move in <unk> with stock prices . 
The economy does , however , depend on the confidence of businesses , consumers and foreign investors . 
A panic on Wall Street does n't exactly <unk> confidence . 
<unk> suggested that consumer confidence was high before Friday . 
A <unk> drop is n't likely * to make much of a <unk> ; * <unk> that a few times over , though , and it will *?* . 
If the reactions of executives gathered * Saturday at <unk> Springs , Va. , for the Business Council meetings are typical , business leaders were n't overly <unk> * by Friday 's decline . 
And if foreign investors become a <unk> more cautious -- well , the dollar 's recent strength suggests that the U.S. can stand it . 
On the bottom line , the most <unk> fact for the economic outlook is that we 've been through this before . 
Two years ago , about the only point of comparison was the 1929 crash and the subsequent Depression . 
The <unk> had a <unk> audience . 
The prosperity that *T* followed Black Monday permits a more optimistic view today . 
At the very least , the establishment here is taking comfort from the nation 's success in * handling the last <unk> . 
As Sen. Lloyd Bentsen -LRB- D. , Texas -RRB- observed yesterday , `` The Fed avoided a <unk> last time . 
They are more sophisticated this time . 
The chemical industry is expected * to report that profits eroded in the third quarter because of <unk> prices in the commodity end of the business . 
<unk> of commodity chemicals , the basic chemicals produced * in huge volumes for other manufacturers , have seen sharp inventory cutting by buyers . 
* Once the chief beneficiaries of the industry 's now <unk> boom , these producers also will be reporting against <unk> strong performances in the 1988 third quarter . 
`` For some of these companies , this will be the first quarter with year-to-year negative comparisons , '' says *T* Leonard <unk> , a chemical industry analyst at Prudential <unk> Research . 
`` This could be the first of five or six down quarters . '' 
* Perhaps most prominent , Dow Chemical Co. , which as of <unk> *T* had <unk> up eight consecutive record quarters , is expected * to report that profit decreased in the latest quarter from a year earlier , if only by a <unk> . 
Though Dow has aggressively diversified into specialty chemicals and pharmaceuticals , the company still has a big stake in <unk> , which *T* is used * in packaging and <unk> . 
Analysts ' third-quarter estimates for the Midland , Mich. , company are between $ <unk> *U* a share and $ <unk> *U* a share , compared with $ <unk> *U* a year ago , when profit was $ <unk> million *U* on sales of $ <unk> billion *U* *T* . 
A Dow spokeswoman declined * to comment on the estimates . 
At the investment firm of Smith Barney , Harris Upham & Co. , the <unk> segment is seen * pulling down overall profit for 20 companies representative of the whole industry by 8 % to 10 % *U* . 
`` You will find the commodities off more than the others and the diversified companies about even or slightly better , '' says *T* James <unk> , a Smith Barney analyst . 
First Boston Corp. projects that 10 of the 15 companies 0 it follows *T* will report lower profit . 
Most of the 10 have big <unk> operations . 
Still , some industry giants are expected * to report continuing gains , largely because so much of their business is outside commodity chemicals . 
Du Pont Co. is thought * to have had steady profit growth in white <unk> , fibers and <unk> . 
Moreover , the Wilmington , Del. , company is helped * when prices <unk> weaken on the commodity chemicals 0 it buys *T* for its own production needs , such as <unk> *T* . 
Analysts are divided * over whether Du Pont will report much of a gain <unk> in the latest quarter from its <unk> Inc. oil company . 
The estimates for Du Pont range from $ 2.25 to $ <unk> *U* a share . 
In the 1988 third quarter , the company earned $ <unk> million *U* , or $ <unk> *U* a share , on sales of $ <unk> billion *U* . 
Du Pont declined * to comment . 
Monsanto Co. , too , is expected * to continue * reporting higher profit , even though its sales of crop chemicals were hurt * in the latest quarter by drought in northern Europe and the western U.S. . 
The St. Louis-based company is expected * to report again that losses in its <unk> Searle & Co. pharmaceutical business are narrowing . 
Searle continued * to operate in the red through the first half of the year , but Monsanto has said 0 it expects Searle to post a profit for all of 1989 . 
Most estimates for Monsanto run between $ <unk> and $ 2 *U* a share . 
A year ago , the company posted third-quarter profit of $ <unk> million *U* , or $ <unk> *U* a share , on sales of $ <unk> billion *U* . 
Monsanto declined * to comment . 
But the <unk> producers are caught * on the <unk> of a pricing cycle . 
By some accounts on Wall Street and in the industry , the inventory reductions are near an end , which *T* may <unk> firmer demand . 
But <unk> say 0 growing production capacity could keep pressure on prices into the early 1990s . 
In the latest quarter , at least , profit is expected * to fall sharply . 
For <unk> Inc. , `` how far down it is *T* , we do n't know *T* , '' says *T* Leslie <unk> at Salomon Brothers . 
The projections are in the neighborhood of 50 cents <unk> a share to 75 cents , compared with a restated $ <unk> *U* a share a year earlier , when profit was $ <unk> million *U* on sales of $ <unk> million *U* . 
<unk> faces lower prices for its <unk> product , <unk> , while it goes forward with a heavy capital investment program 0 *T* to bolster its raw material supply and develop new uses for <unk> , whose markets *T* include the packaging and automobile industries . 
The company , based * in Wilmington , Del. , is <unk> by Montedison <unk> . A. , Milan , which *T* has an offer outstanding for the <unk> shares 0 it does n't already own *T* . 
At Quantum Chemical Corp. , New York , the trouble is lower prices for <unk> , higher debt costs and the <unk> of an important plant due to an explosion . 
Some analysts hedge their estimates for Quantum , because it <unk> is n't known * when the company will book certain one-time charges *T* . 
But the estimates range from <unk> to 35 cents a share . 
In the 1988 third quarter , Quantum earned $ <unk> million *U* , or $ <unk> *U* a share , on sales of $ <unk> million *U* . 
Another big <unk> producer , Union Carbide Corp. , is expected * to post profit of between $ 1 *U* a share and $ 1.25 *U* , compared with $ <unk> *U* a share a year earlier , when the company earned $ <unk> million *U* on sales of $ <unk> billion *U* *T* . 
<unk> , Quantum and Union Carbide all declined * to comment . 
The following were among Friday 's offerings and <unk> in the U.S. and <unk> capital markets , with terms and syndicate manager , as * compiled * by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report : 
Dow Chemical Co. -- 
$ 150 million *U* of <unk> % senior notes due Oct. 15 , <unk> , priced * at par . 
The issue , which *T* is <unk> back to the company at par on Oct. 15 , 1999 , was priced * at a spread of 50 basis points above the Treasury 's 10-year note . 
* <unk> * single-A-1 by Moody 's Investors Service Inc. and single-A by Standard & Poor 's Corp. , the <unk> issue will be sold * through underwriters led * by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets . 
Centel Capital Corp. --

Thursday 's report on the September consumer price index is expected * to rise , although not as sharply as the 0.9 % gain reported * Friday in the producer price index . 
That gain was being cited * as a reason 0 the stock market was down early in Friday 's session , before it got * started * on its <unk> <unk> plunge *T* . 
Economists are divided * as to how much manufacturing strength they expect * to see *T* in September reports on industrial production and capacity utilization , also due tomorrow . 
Meanwhile , September housing starts , due Wednesday , are thought * to have inched upward . 
`` There 's a possibility of a surprise '' in the trade report , said 0 *T* Michael <unk> , director of research at <unk> . 
A widening of the deficit , if it were combined * with a <unk> strong dollar , would <unk> trade problems -- but the dollar weakened Friday as stocks plummeted . 
In any event , Mr. <unk> and many others say that the easy gains in * narrowing the trade gap have already been made * . 
`` Trade is definitely going * to be more politically sensitive over the next six or seven months as improvement begins * to slow , '' he said *T* . 
Exports are thought * to have risen strongly in August , but probably not enough * to offset the jump in imports , economists said *T* . 
<unk> on manufacturing strength are split between economists who *T* read September 's low level of factory job growth as a sign of a slowdown and those who *T* use the somewhat more <unk> total employment figures in their calculations . 
The wide range of estimates for the industrial output number underscores the differences : The forecasts run from a drop of 0.5 % to an increase of 0.4 % , according to <unk> . 
A rebound in energy prices , which *T* helped push up the producer price index , is expected * to do the same in the consumer price report . 
The consensus view expects a 0.4 % increase in the September <unk> after a flat reading in August . 
Robert H. <unk> , an economist for Lloyd 's Bank in New York , is among those expecting a more moderate gain in the <unk> than in prices at the producer level . 
`` Auto prices had a big effect in the <unk> , and at the <unk> level they <unk> n't *?* , '' he said *T* . 
Food prices are expected * to be unchanged , but energy costs jumped as much as 4 % , said 0 *T* Gary <unk> , economist at <unk> Financial Group . 
He also says 0 he thinks 0 `` core inflation , '' which *T* <unk> the volatile food and energy prices , was strong last month .

`` Capital City '' is a weekly series that *T* <unk> here three weeks ago amid unprecedented <unk> by its producer , <unk> Television . 
The early <unk> make you long for a <unk> of the crash of 1987 . 
* Let 's make that 1929 , just * to be sure . 
According to the program 's publicity prospectus , `` Capital City , '' set at <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> securities firm with # 500 million *U* capital , `` follows the fortunes of a <unk> team of young , <unk> dealers , hired * for their particular <unk> of style , <unk> and energy . 
But with all the money and <unk> of high finance come *T* the <unk> pressures * to do well ; pressure * to pull off another million before lunch ; pressure * to anticipate the market by a fraction of a second <unk> '' 
You need n't be a <unk> securities lawyer * to realize 0 the prospectus is guilty of less than full disclosure . 
The <unk> produced series has been criticized * by London 's financial <unk> as inaccurate in detail , but its major weakness is its <unk> <unk> of the characters ' professional and private lives . 
* <unk> loose in <unk> <unk> 's trading room , the <unk> dealers do little right . 
* <unk> by the money lost * and mistakes made * in the early <unk> , <unk> <unk> 's capital should be just about exhausted by the final <unk> week . 
In the opening episode we learn that <unk> , a junior bond trader , has indeed pulled off another million before lunch .

Rather than * keep the loss a secret from the outside world , <unk> <unk> about it to a <unk> man while * ordering lunch over the phone . 
Little chance that <unk> <unk> is going * to recoup today . 
Traders spend the morning * <unk> selling bonds , in the belief that the U.S. monthly trade figures will look <unk> .

The trade figures turn out well , and all those recently <unk> bonds <unk> in price . 
So much for * <unk> the market by a fraction of a second . 
And a large <unk> of the first episode is devoted * to efforts * to get rid of some nearly <unk> Japanese bonds -LRB- since when is anything Japanese nearly <unk> <unk> *T* ? -RRB- .

The plot is <unk> * when the firm 's major stockholder , <unk> farming on the other side of the <unk> , <unk> home * to support the executive *T* . 
But the investigation continues . 
If you can <unk> the <unk> that the rewards for such <unk> are <unk> salaries , you still are left * <unk> , because few of the <unk> <unk> very <unk> . 
In fact , few <unk> much of anything . 
Two share a house almost <unk> of furniture .

And it <unk> takes <unk> , the <unk> <unk> ' man of the cast , until the third episode * to get past first base with any of his <unk> . 
Perhaps the explanation for these <unk> is that <unk> Britain is n't ready * to come to terms with the wealth created * by the <unk> <unk> regime . 
After all , this is n't old money , but new money , and in many cases , young money . 
This attitude is clearly <unk> * in the treatment of Max , the trading room 's most <unk> character .

But apparently * to make him <unk> , even <unk> , to the <unk> , the script <unk> <unk> Max into an <unk> <unk> , master of 11 Chinese <unk> . 
He takes his <unk> to the <unk> , where he meets a <unk> French girl who *T* <unk> him into * providing a home for her pet <unk> and then promptly <unk> his car and <unk> it in <unk> *T* . 
In * producing and promoting `` Capital City , '' <unk> has spent about as much as <unk> <unk> loses on a good day . 
The production costs are a not <unk> # 8 million *U* -LRB- $ 12.4 million *U* -RRB- , and would have been much higher had not the cost of the trading floor set been absorbed in the budget of `` Dealers , '' an earlier <unk> movie . 
Another half million <unk> went for a <unk> of <unk> advertisements in six major British newspapers and for huge <unk> in the London subway . 
These expenses create a special incentive for `` Capital City 's '' producers to <unk> it , or a <unk> version of it , in America .

He is <unk> hopeful , * citing three U.S. comedy series -- `` Three 's Company , '' `` Too <unk> for <unk> '' and `` * <unk> It Out '' -- that *T* had British <unk> . 
Perhaps without * <unk> it , Mr. <unk> simultaneously has put his <unk> on the problem and an ideal solution : `` Capital City '' should have been a comedy , a <unk> <unk> to the <unk> British `` <unk> On '' movies of the 1960s . 
The <unk> already are in the script . 
The first episode concluded with a <unk> <unk> scene in which the <unk> crew <unk> a baby , the casualty of a broken marriage at the firm *T* . 
And many in the young cast bear striking <unk> to American TV and movie <unk> known * for light roles .

So , OK kids , everybody *?* on stage for `` * <unk> On * Trading '' : The cast is <unk> searching the office for <unk> Japanese bonds that suddenly *T* have soared in value because <unk> <unk> Bank has just bought the White House .

Mr. <unk> is senior correspondent in the Journal 's London bureau . 
<unk> <unk> of France gave details of its financing plans for its proposed $ 4.5 billion *U* acquisition of Farmers Group Inc. , in amended filings with insurance regulators in the nine U.S. states where Farmers operates *T* . 
The proposed acquisition is part of Sir James Goldsmith 's unfriendly takeover attempt for B.A.T Industries PLC , the British tobacco , retailing , paper and financial services concern that *T* is parent of Los Angeles-based Farmers . 
In an attempt * to <unk> U.S. regulators ' concern over a Goldsmith acquisition of Farmers , Sir James in August agreed * to sell Farmers to <unk> if he is successful in * acquiring B.A.T . 
As part of the agreement , <unk> agreed * to invest $ 1 billion *U* in <unk> Investments Ltd. , Sir James 's acquisition vehicle . 
Of the total $ 5.5 billion *U* 0 *T* to be paid * to <unk> by <unk> , about $ 1 billion *U* *T* will come from available resources of <unk> 's parent , <unk> Group , $ 2.25 billion *U* *T* will be in the form of notes issued * by <unk> , and the remaining $ 2.25 billion *U* *T* will be in long-term bank loans . 
In an interview Thursday , <unk> <unk> , chairman and chief executive officer of <unk> , said 0 his group has already obtained assurances <unk> from a group of banks led * by <unk> . <unk> de Paribas that they can provide the loan portion of the financing . 
The other banking companies in the group are Credit <unk> , Societe Generale , BankAmerica Corp. and Citicorp , he said 0 *T* . 
Mr. <unk> said 0 <unk> Group has `` more than $ 2.5 billion *U* of <unk> assets that we can and will sell '' *T* * to help * pay off debt from the acquisition . 
He said 0 the assets 0 *T* to be sold * would be `` <unk> '' assets , including a beer company and a real estate firm , and would n't include any pieces of Farmers . 
`` We <unk> n't put any burden on Farmers , '' he said *T* . 
The amended filings also point out that under a new agreement , <unk> has an absolute obligation * to sell Farmers to <unk> upon an acquisition of B.A.T . 
`` We hope that with what we did *T* , the regulators will not need * to evaluate <unk> , and they can directly look at the agreement with us , because <unk> <unk> n't be an owner of Farmers at anytime , '' Mr. <unk> said *T* . 
Any change of control in Farmers needs approval of the insurance commissioners in the nine states where Farmers and its related companies are incorporated * *T* . 
The amended filings were required * because of the new agreement between <unk> and <unk> , and * to reflect the extension that Sir James received *T* last month under British takeover rules * to complete his proposed acquisition . 
<unk> dropped its initial # <unk> billion *U* -LRB- $ <unk> billion *U* -RRB- takeover bid after it received the extension , but said 0 it would launch a new bid if and when the <unk> sale of Farmers to <unk> receives regulatory approval *T* . 
A spokesman for B.A.T said of the amended filings that , `` It would appear that nothing substantive has changed . 
The new financing structure is still a <unk> leveraged one , and <unk> still plans * to take out 75 % of Farmers ' earnings as dividends * to service their debt . '' 
That dividend is almost double the 35 % currently taken out of Farmers by B.A.T , the spokesman added 0 *T* . 
`` It would have severe implications for Farmers ' policy holders . '' 
* To fend off Sir James 's advances , B.A.T has proposed a sweeping restructuring that *T* would <unk> it to a tobacco and financial services concern .

The heavy use of incentives * to clear out 1989 models appears * to have taken the steam , at least initially , out of 1990 model sales , which *T* began officially Oct. 1 . 
This appears particularly true at GM , which *T* had strong sales in August and September but saw its early October car and truck results fall <unk> % from last year 's unusually high level . 
Overall , sales of all <unk> vehicles fell <unk> % from a year ago . 
Without GM , overall sales for the other U.S. <unk> were roughly flat with 1989 results . 
Some of the U.S. auto makers have already adopted incentives on many 1990 models , but they may have * to broaden their programs * to keep sales up . 
`` We 've created a condition where , without incentives , it 's a tough market *T* , '' said *T* Tom Kelly , sales manager for Bill <unk> Chevrolet in <unk> , <unk> .

Furthermore , dealers contacted late last week said 0 they could n't see any immediate impact on sales of Friday 's steep market decline . 
GM 's domestic car sales dropped <unk> % and its domestic trucks were down an even <unk> <unk> % from the same period a year ago . 
All of the GM divisions except Cadillac showed big declines . 
Cadillac posted a 3.2 % increase despite new competition from <unk> , the <unk> <unk> division of Toyota Motor <unk> . 
<unk> sales were n't available ; the cars are imported * and Toyota reports their sales only at <unk> . 
The sales drop for the No. 1 car maker may have been caused * in part by the end in September of dealer incentives that GM offered *T* in addition to consumer rebates and <unk> financing , a company spokesman said 0 *T* . 
Last year , GM had a different program <unk> in place that *T* continued * <unk> dealers until all the 1989 models had been sold * .

Ford Motor Co. had a 1.8 % drop in domestic car sales but a 2.4 % increase in domestic truck sales .

Separately , Chrysler said 0 firm prices on its <unk> domestic cars and <unk> will rise an average of 5 % over <unk> equipped 1989 models .

Now , the network has opened a news bureau in the Hungarian capital .

In fact , the network hopes * to set up offices in Warsaw and anywhere else in the East <unk> that *T* will have it . 
But the rapid changes brought on by glasnost and open borders are <unk> the network 's life in more ways than one . 
In fact , Radio Free Europe is in danger of * suffering from its success . 
While the network currently can operate freely in <unk> , so can *?* *T* others . 
In addition , competition for <unk> is getting tougher in many ways than when * broadcasting here was strictly controlled * *T* . 
Instead of * being denounced * as an evil agent of <unk> , Radio Free Europe is more likely * to draw the criticism that its programs are too <unk> , even <unk> . 
`` They have a lot 0 * to do *T* these days * to compete with Hungarian radio , '' says *T* Andrew <unk> , a <unk> student at the Technical University in <unk> . 
`` The Hungarian -LCB- radio -RCB- reporters seem better informed and more critical about about what *T* 's going on here . '' 
Indeed , Hungary is in the midst of a media explosion .

But Radio Free Europe does n't plan * to <unk> away . 
With its mission for free speech and the capitalist way , the network 's staff says 0 it still has plenty 0 * to do *T* -- in Hungary and in the `` Great Eastern Beyond . '' 
Radio Free Europe and its sister station for the Soviet Union , Radio Liberty , say 0 they <unk> n't cut back their more than 19 hours of daily broadcasts . 
They are still an important source of news for 60 million <unk> in 23 exotic <unk> : from <unk> and <unk> to <unk> and <unk> . 
The establishment of its first bureau in Warsaw Pact territory shows the depth of some of the changes in Eastern Europe . 
<unk> before the decision <unk> by the Hungarian Communist Party * to <unk> itself Socialist and try * to look more appealing to voters , the country 's <unk> were trying * to look more <unk> . 
It <unk> proved a perfect time for Radio Free Europe to ask for permission * to set up office . 
Not only did the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs approve Radio Free Europe 's new location , but the Ministry of Telecommunications did something even more <unk> : `` They found us four phone lines in central <unk> , '' says *T* <unk> <unk> , a Radio Free Europe correspondent who *T* helped * organize the <unk> location . 
`` That is a <unk> . '' 
It 's a far cry from the previous treatment of the network , which *T* had * to overcome <unk> of its <unk> and <unk> of local <unk> -LRB- who *T* filed reports to the network by phone , secret <unk> or letters -RRB- . 
In fact , some of the network 's Hungarian <unk> say 0 they owe Radio Free Europe loyalty because it was responsible in many ways for * keeping hope alive through what one writer here calls *T* the `` <unk> <unk> of the 20th Century . '' 
`` During the past four years , many of us have sat up until late at night * listening to our <unk> , '' says *T* the writer . 
`` There were some very <unk> broadcasts . '' 
The <unk> , too , had * to be <unk> . 
Through much of the <unk> War II period , * listening to Western broadcasts was a crime in Hungary . 
`` When we listen to the Europe station *T* , my mother still gets nervous , '' says *T* a <unk> <unk> . 
`` She wants * to turn down the volume and close the <unk> . '' 
Now , the toughest competition for Radio Free Europe comes during the <unk> <unk> . 
Hungarian radio often <unk> its most politically outspoken broadcasts for around midnight . 
Television , which most of the time *T* is considered * rather <unk> , has entered the running with a new program , `` The <unk> of the Day , '' which *T* comes on after 11 <unk> . 
It is a talk show with opposition leaders and political experts who *T* discuss Hungary 's domestic problems as well as foreign affairs . 
Those who *T* want * to hear even more radical views have * to get up at five on Sunday morning for `` Sunday Journal , '' on Hungarian Radio . 
The competitive spirit is clearly <unk> Radio Free Europe , which *T* is trying * to beef up programs . 
The <unk> office plans * to hire free-lance reporters * to cover the latest <unk> in Hungarian country towns from <unk> in the west to <unk> in the east . 
The Hungarian service has a daily <unk> news show called * <unk> , with international and domestic news , plus a daily news review of opinions from around the world . 
There 's also a host of new programs , trying * to <unk> up on the traditional diet of politics . 
A daily <unk> program called * `` The March of Time '' tries * to find interesting <unk> of <unk> news and <unk> from around the world . 
There 's a program for women and a science show . 
And * to attract younger <unk> , Radio Free Europe <unk> the latest in Western rock groups . 
The <unk> Shop <unk> are big this year in <unk> . 
`` We are <unk> for all the news , '' says *T* Mr. <unk> , the student . 
`` Every moment we want * to know everything about the world . 
<unk> for <unk> `` national service , '' like <unk> , <unk> up from time to time , depress the resistance of the body <unk> , run their course , and seem * to disappear , only * to <unk> and <unk> public life <unk> . 
The disease <unk> comes to mind , of course , not as an <unk> on the advocates of national service . 
Rather , it is born * of frustration with * having * to combat constantly changing strains of a <unk> idea that one thought 0 *T* had been eliminated * in the early 1970s , along with <unk> . 
It is back with us again , in the form of legislation * to pay volunteers under a `` National and Community Service Act , '' a proposal with a serious shot at congressional passage this fall . 
Why does the <unk> virus keep coming back *T* ? 
Perhaps it is because <unk> <unk> <unk> both military experience and the social <unk> . 
If only we could get America 's <unk> youth into at least a <unk> uniform we might be able * to teach <unk> again and revive the spirit of giving . 
A quarter of a century ago national service was promoted * as a way of * <unk> the <unk> <unk> of the draft -- by , of all things , * expanding the draft . 
Those of us who *T* resisted the idea then suspect today that an obligation of government service for all young people is still the true long-term aim of many <unk> backers , despite their protests that present plans contain no <unk> . 
<unk> of the <unk> military in the 1970s seemed * to <unk> national service as much as the draft . 
But the virus was kept * alive in <unk> departments until a couple of years ago , when it again was let * loose *T* . 
This time it attempted * to <unk> two connected problems , the rising cost of higher education and the rising expense to the federal government of educational grants and loans . 
Why not * keep <unk> and even expand <unk> the loans and grants , the advocates <unk> *T* , but * require some form of service from each <unk> ? 
Military service , moreover , could be a <unk> option . 
Thus , undoubtedly it <unk> was hoped * that the new strain of national service would prove <unk> , * <unk> <unk> conservatives , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> liberals . 
The Democratic <unk> Council , a <unk> group <unk> the plan , surely thought 0 it might help the party to attract support , especially among college students and their parents . 
A provision allowing grants * to be applied * to <unk> purchases was added * * to appeal to those who *T* had had enough of <unk> . 
The <unk> plan <unk> `` volunteers '' <unk> trees <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> children <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> for $ 100 *U* a week , tax free , plus medical care . 
With a tax-free $ 10,000 *U* <unk> payment at the end of each year , the volunteers would be making a wage comparable to $ <unk> *U* a year . 
<unk> you , most of `` the volunteers '' would be <unk> 17 - to <unk> , some not even high school graduates , and many saving money by * living at home . 
They would be doing better financially under national service than many taxpayers working at the same kinds of jobs and perhaps supporting families . 
As it happened , political resistance developed among educational and minority interests that *T* count on the present education grant system , so the <unk> <unk> decided * to abandon the supposedly crucial principle of `` * give in order * to get . '' 
<unk> to national service from the Pentagon , which *T* wants * to protect its own <unk> process , also led to the <unk> option being dropped * . 
Clearly , a new <unk> for national service had * to be <unk> up . 
What better place 0 * to turn *T* than Sen. Edward Kennedy 's Labor Committee , that great <unk> of government <unk> , where many a <unk> <unk> of <unk> is kept * on the back <unk> until it can be brought forward and presented as <unk> <unk> *T* ? 
In this case , the new <unk> for national service called for * throwing many <unk> legislative <unk> into one <unk> : a demonstration project for educational aid -LRB- particularly <unk> to the <unk> and Sen. Sam Nunn -RRB- , a similar demonstration program for youth conservation -LRB- a la Sen. Chris <unk> -RRB- , a competitive grants program to states 0 *T* to spark youth and senior citizen <unk> projects -LRB- a Kennedy specialty -RRB- , a community service <unk> program for students -LRB- <unk> to the <unk> of Sen. Dale <unk> , among others -RRB- , plus <unk> of the <unk> <unk> program and the <unk> Senior <unk> , Foster <unk> , and Senior <unk> programs . 
Before the <unk> is printed * , the House may add more <unk> , also * changing the initial price , now posted at some $ 330 million *U* . 
It is widely known * that `` too many <unk> <unk> the <unk> , '' but that wisdom does not necessarily reflect the view of the <unk> , especially if they are senators . 
The `` <unk> '' bill coming out of Congress may be <unk> <unk> , but the <unk> <unk> are happy and the restaurant is pushing the <unk> very hard . 
The <unk> of <unk> is in the air . 
Is the voluntary sector so weak that it needs such unsolicited assistance ? 
On the contrary , it is as robust as ever . 
According to the <unk> <unk> , American adults contribute an average of two hours a week of service , while financial contributions to charity in the 1980s have risen 30 % -LRB- adjusted * for inflation -RRB- . 
Even if government does see various `` <unk> needs , '' national service is not the way 0 * to meet them *T* . 
If we want * to support students , we might adopt the idea used * in other countries of * offering more <unk> based * on something called * `` <unk> , '' rather than on the government 's idea of `` service . '' 
Or we might provide a tax credit for working students . 
What we do not need * to do *T* is * start a war , and then try * to justify it by * creating a <unk> Bill . 
To the extent 0 we lack <unk> 0 *T* to staff <unk> jobs in hospitals *T* , for example , we should raise pay , pursue <unk> technology , or allow more legal immigration , rather than <unk> high school graduates as short-term workers and cause <unk> among permanent workers paid * lesser amounts * to do the same jobs . 
Will national service , in the current highly <unk> and <unk> form <unk> enough appeal * to get adopted * ? 
Not necessarily . 
<unk> show wide , <unk> support for some vague concept of service , but the bill now under discussion lacks any <unk> public backing . 
Nonetheless , Senate Democrats are organizing a roll of supporting `` associations , '' `` <unk> '' and `` <unk> , '' some of which *T* may hope * to receive the paid `` volunteers . '' 
So far , the president seems <unk> * to substitute any of the <unk> for his own <unk> proposal * to <unk> a `` <unk> of Light '' foundation with $ 25 million *U* * to <unk> citizens of all ages and <unk> them to genuine <unk> . 
However , even this <unk> plan could become <unk> if the White House gives in to congressional Democratic pressure * to add to the scope of the president 's initiative or * to involve the independent foundation in * `` <unk> '' federal funds for <unk> projects . 
There 's no need for such concessions . 
The <unk> can be defeated * , the virus controlled * , and real service protected * . 
National service , the <unk> idea , still <unk> n't go away then , of course , but the millions of <unk> youth performing works of `` <unk> content '' will be <unk> * only in the <unk> of their <unk> . 
Mr. Chapman is a fellow at the <unk> Hudson Institute . 
This article is <unk> * from remarks at a Hoover Institution conference on national service , in which Mr. <unk> also participated *T* . 
Drug <unk> Inc. said 0 Gary <unk> , 39 years old , who *T* had been president and chief operating officer for the past year , was named * chief executive officer of this <unk> chain . 
He succeeds his father , Philip T. <unk> , who *T* founded the company and remains chairman . 
Robert E. Lyons III , 39 , who *T* headed the company 's Philadelphia region , was appointed * president and chief operating officer , * succeeding Gary <unk> . 
American <unk> Service Group Inc. said 0 it purchased about 42 % of Prime Medical Services Inc. for about $ 5 million *U* from Texas American Energy <unk> . 
American <unk> said 0 it also replaced four Texas American representatives on Prime 's <unk> board . 
American provides a variety of financial services to doctors and hospitals . 
Prime , based * in <unk> , N.J. , provides management services to <unk> <unk> clinics and diagnostic <unk> centers . 
For the year ended June 30 , Prime had a net loss of $ 3 million *U* on sales of $ <unk> million *U* . 
The inflation-adjusted growth rate for France 's gross domestic product for the second quarter was revised * upward to 0.8 % from the previous three months from the initial estimate of 0.7 % , the National Statistics Institute said 0 *T* . 
The state agency said 0 the latest revision left the growth rate for the first-quarter compared with the previous three months unchanged at 1.3 % . 
If the economy continues * to expand by 0.8 % a quarter for the rest of the year , it would leave <unk> growth for all of 1989 at 3 % , the institute said 0 *T* . 
That would be down from the 3.8 % rise posted * in 1988 . 
The Canadian government announced a new , <unk> Canada Savings Bond issue that *T* will yield investors 10.5 % in the first year . 
The annual interest rate for each of the next 11 years will be set * each fall , when details of a new series are released * *T* . 
Canada Savings Bonds are major government instruments for * meeting its financial requirements . 
The government has about <unk> billion Canadian dollars -LRB- <unk> <unk> billion *U* -RRB- of such bonds currently outstanding . 
Only Canadian residents are permitted * to buy Canada Savings Bonds , which *T* may be redeemed * any time at face value . 
The bonds go on sale Oct. 19 . 
The debate over National Service has begun again . 
After a decade in which more than 50 <unk> established their own service or conservation <unk> and dozens of school systems made community service a <unk> to high-school <unk> *T* , the focus has shifted to Washington . 
At least 10 bills proposing one or another national program were introduced * in Congress this spring . 
One , <unk> by Sen. Sam Nunn -LRB- D. , <unk> . -RRB- and Rep. <unk> <unk> -LRB- D. , Okla. -RRB- , would have restricted federal college subsidies to students who *T* had served . 
An <unk> bill assembled by Sen. Edward Kennedy -LRB- D. , Mass. -RRB- , and including some diluted <unk> provisions along with proposals by fellow Democratic <unk> <unk> <unk> , Barbara <unk> and Christopher <unk> , has been reported * out of the Senate Labor Committee . 
It might well win Senate passage . 
President Bush has outlined his own <unk> <unk> Service -LRB- <unk> -RRB- plan , though its details remain * to be specified * . 
What is one * to think *T* of all this ? 
<unk> and special interests govern some responses . 
People eager * to have youth `` pay their <unk> to society '' favor service proposals -- <unk> mandatory ones . 
So do *T* those who *T* seek a `` <unk> concept of <unk> , '' a concept imposing <unk> obligations as well as <unk> rights . 
Then there are <unk> opponents . 
To <unk> , mandatory service is an <unk> and voluntary systems are <unk> uses of tax money . 
<unk> of the market question the value of the work 0 national service would perform *T* : 
If the market <unk> n't pay for it , they argue , it <unk> n't be worth its cost . 
<unk> of the left are also <unk> opposed * ; they see service as a cover for the draft , or fear the <unk> of youth , or want * to see rights <unk> * , not obligations *?* * . 
But what about those of us whose views *T* are not <unk> * by formula or ideology ? 
How should we think about national service *T* ? 
* Let 's begin by * <unk> a main source of confusion -- `` national service '' has no agreed meaning . 
Would service be voluntary or <unk> ? 
Short or long ? 
<unk> or full-time ? 
<unk> or unpaid ? 
Would participants live at home and work nearby or live in <unk> and work on public lands ? 
What kinds of work would they do *T* ? 
What does `` national '' mean *T* ? 
Would the program be run by the federal government , by local governments , or by private voluntary organizations ? 
And who *T* would serve ? 
Only <unk> , as with the draft , or both <unk> ? 
<unk> only or all ages ? 
<unk> people , or poor people , or a genuine <unk> ? 
Many or few ? 
Those are not <unk> questions , and the label `` national service '' answers none of them . 
Then how should we think about national service *T* ? 
As a starting point , here are five <unk> : 1 . * Consider the <unk> , not the name . 
* <unk> `` national service '' in the <unk> ; * consider specific proposals . 
They will differ in crucial ways . 
2 . `` Service '' should be service . 
As * commonly understood * , service implies sacrifice . 
It involves * accepting risk , or * giving up income , or * <unk> a career . 
It follows that proposals like <unk> , whose benefits to <unk> *T* are worth some $ <unk> *U* a year , do not qualify . 
There is a <unk> for such bills : Federal subsidies to college students amount to `` a <unk> Bill without the <unk> '' ; <unk> those benefits should be earned * , not given * . 
But the earnings exceed by 20 % the average income of young high-school graduates with full-time jobs . 
Why * call that service ? 
3 . <unk> is fine ; <unk> is not *?* . 
<unk> service is unconstitutional . 
It is also <unk> and <unk> . 
-LRB- Who *T* will throw several hundred thousand <unk> in jail each year ? -RRB- 
But through tax policy and in other ways the federal government encourages many kinds of behavior . 
It should also encourage service -- <unk> by all classes and all ages . 
Its <unk> should strengthen <unk> and not undercut <unk> the strong tradition of <unk> in the U.S. , should build on the service programs already in existence , and should honor local convictions about which tasks *T* most need doing . 
4 . Good programs are not cheap . 
<unk> assume that national service would get important work done <unk> : forest fires fought * , housing <unk> * , students <unk> * , day-care centers <unk> * . 
There is important work 0 *T* to be done * , and existing service and conservation <unk> have shown that even <unk> who *T* start with few skills can do much of it well -- but not <unk> . 
Good service programs require <unk> , screening , training and supervision -- all of high quality . 
They involve <unk> to participants . 
<unk> residential programs also require housing and full-time supervision ; they are particularly expensive -- more per participant than a year at Stanford or Yale . 
<unk> programs are cheaper , but good ones still come to some $ 10,000 *U* a year . 
Are they worth that ? 
<unk> suggest that good ones are *?* -- especially so if the effects on participants are counted * . 
But the calculations are <unk> . 
5 . <unk> youth are a special concern . 
Are such expenditures <unk> , then ? 
Yes , if * targeted * . 
People of all ages and all classes should be encouraged * to serve , but there are many ways for middle-class kids , and their <unk> , to serve at little public cost . 
They can <unk> at any of thousands of <unk> institutions , or participate in service programs required * by high schools or encouraged * by colleges or employers . 
<unk> youth do n't have those opportunities . 
They are not <unk> in high school or college . 
They are unlikely * to be employed * . 
And they have grown up in <unk> <unk> circumstances , among family structures breaking down , * surrounded by <unk> <unk> and <unk> prospects . 
But many of them can be quite <unk> <unk> * by productive and <unk> service . 
Some <unk> n't accept the discipline ; others drop out for other reasons . 
But some whom nothing else is reaching *T* are transformed * . 
* <unk> skills , producing something <unk> , feeling useful , they are no longer dependent -- others now depend on them . 
Even if it <unk> is cheaper * to build <unk> or paint apartments or plant <unk> with paid professionals , the effects on the young people providing those services alter the <unk> . 
* <unk> speaking , these youth are not performing service . 
They are giving up no income , <unk> no careers , <unk> no risk . 
But they believe themselves to be serving , and they begin * to respect themselves -LRB- and others -RRB- , to take control of their lives , to think of the future . 
That is a service to the nation . 
It is what federal support should try hardest * to achieve *T* . 
Mr. <unk> , a Carter administration budget official , heads his own Washington-based strategic planning firm . 
He is a <unk> of `` National Service : What Would It <unk> *T* ? '' 
-LRB- Lexington Books , 1986 -RRB- . 
Government officials here and in other countries laid plans <unk> through the weekend * to head off a Monday market <unk> -- but went out of their way * to keep their moves quiet . 
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was on the telephones , * making it <unk> clear to officials in the U.S. and abroad that the Fed was prepared * to <unk> massive amounts of money into the banking system , as it did in October 1987 , if the action were needed * to prevent a financial crisis . 
And at the Treasury , Secretary Nicholas Brady talked with friends and associates on Wall Street while Assistant Secretary David <unk> carefully <unk> data on the Friday market plunge . 
But the officials feared that any public announcements would only increase market <unk> . 
In addition , officials at the Fed and in the Bush administration decided that * avoiding <unk> actions and statements over the weekend would give them more strength and flexibility should Friday 's market drop turn into this morning 's <unk> . 
`` The disadvantage at this point is that anything 0 you do *T* that *T* looks like you are doing too much tends * to <unk> a sense of crisis , '' said *T* one government official , insisting on anonymity . 
The Fed 's efforts at secrecy were partly <unk> * Sunday morning , when both the New York Times and the Washington Post carried stories <unk> a senior Fed official saying 0 the central bank was prepared * to <unk> cash into the banking system Monday morning *T* . 
Fed Chairman Greenspan was surprised * by both stories , according to <unk> sources , and insisted 0 he had n't authorized any public comment . 
Nevertheless , Fed officials acknowledged 0 the stories were reasonably accurate <unk> of the central bank 's game plan . 
It is prepared * to assume the same role 0 it played *T* in October 1987 , * providing money to the markets if * necessary * to keep the financial system <unk> . 
The Fed provides money to the banking system by * buying government securities from financial institutions . 
The <unk> of federal officials was evident in the appearance Sunday of Budget Director Richard <unk> on ABC 's `` This Week . '' 
`` Secretary of the Treasury Brady and Chairman Greenspan and the chairman of the SEC and others have been in close contact . 
I 'm sure 0 they 'll do what *T* 's right , what *T* 's prudent , what *T* 's sensible , '' he said *T* . 
When it was suggested * 0 his comment was a `` <unk> *T* , '' Mr. <unk> replied : `` It is a <unk> . 
But , in this context , that 's the smart thing 0 * to do *T* . '' 
At the Treasury , Secretary Brady issued a statement <unk> the stock market 's drop . 
`` Today 's stock market decline does n't signal any fundamental change in the condition of the economy , '' he said *T* . 
`` The economy remains <unk> , and the outlook is for continued moderate growth . '' 
But administration officials conceded that Friday 's drop carried the chance of further declines this week . 
`` One possibility is that this is a <unk> setback , reasonably limited in its <unk> , and not a major problem , '' said *T* one senior administration official , who also *T* asked that he not be named * . 
`` The other is that we see another major disaster , like two years ago . 
I think 0 that 's less likely . '' 
Nevertheless , Fed Chairman Greenspan and Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson were in their offices Sunday evening , * monitoring events as they <unk> in markets around the world . 
The action was expected * to begin with the opening of the New Zealand foreign exchange markets at 5 p.m. EST -- when stocks there plunged *T* -- and to continue as the trading day began later in the evening in Tokyo and through early this morning in Europe . 
Both the Treasury and the Fed planned * to keep market rooms operating throughout the night * to monitor the developments . 
In Tokyo , share prices dropped sharply by 1.7 % in early Monday morning trading . 
After the initial slide , the market appeared * to be turning around but by early afternoon was headed lower . 
In the Bush administration , the lead is being taken * by Treasury Secretary Brady , <unk> Robert <unk> and Assistant Secretary <unk> . 
The three men worked together on the so-called Brady Commission , headed * by Mr. Brady , which *T* was established * after the 1987 crash * to examine the market 's collapse . 
As a result they have extensive knowledge in financial markets , and financial market <unk> . 
Mr. Brady was at the White House Friday afternoon when the stock market 's decline began *T* . 
He was quickly on the phone with Mr. <unk> , who in turn *T* was talking with the chairmen of the New York and Chicago exchanges . 
Later , Mr. Brady <unk> Mr. Greenspan , SEC Chairman Richard <unk> and numerous contacts in New York and overseas . 
<unk> say 0 he continued * to work the phones through the weekend . 
Administration officials say 0 President Bush was <unk> * throughout Friday afternoon and evening , even after * leaving for <unk> David . 
He had frequent telephone <unk> with Mr. Brady and Michael <unk> , chairman of the counsel of economic advisers . 
Government officials tried throughout the weekend * to <unk> a <unk> appearance in order * to avoid any sense of panic . 
Treasury <unk> David <unk> , for instance , was at a meeting of the Business Council in <unk> Springs , Va. , when the stock market fell *T* , and remained there through the following day . 
And as of last night , Fed Chairman Greenspan had n't canceled his plans * to address the American Bankers Association convention in Washington at 10 a.m. this morning . 
Ironically , Mr. Greenspan was scheduled * to address the same convention in Dallas on Oct. 20 , 1987 . 
He flew to Dallas on Oct. 19 , when the market plummeted <unk> points *T* , but then turned around the next morning and returned to Washington without * delivering his speech . 
Following is *T* a weekly listing of <unk> net asset values of publicly traded investment fund shares , reported * by the companies as of Friday 's close . 
Also shown * is *T* the closing listed market price or a <unk> asked price of each fund 's shares , with the percentage of difference . 
<unk> - As of Thursday 's close . 
<unk> - * <unk> at Commercial <unk> exchange rate . 
<unk> - In Canadian dollars . 
<unk> - As of Wednesday 's close . 
<unk> - <unk> <unk> . 
<unk> - Not available . 
* <unk> down that phone . 
* <unk> around the room ; * take two deep <unk> . 
* <unk> the urge * to call your broker and sell all your stocks . 
That 's the advice of most investment professionals after Friday 's <unk> drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average . 
No one can say for sure what *T* will happen today . 
And investment <unk> are divided on whether stocks will perform well or badly in the next six months . 
But they 're nearly unanimous on one point : * Do n't sell into a panic . 
Investors who *T* sold everything after the crash of 1987 lived * to <unk> it . 
Even after Friday 's plunge , the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 48 % above where it landed on Oct. 19 two years ago *T* . 
<unk> selling also was <unk> during other big declines in the past . 
The crash of 1929 was followed * by a substantial recovery before the great Depression and awful bear market of the 1930s began . 
The `` October <unk> '' of 1978 and 1979 were <unk> , but did n't lead to severe or sustained <unk> . 
Indeed , some <unk> see Friday 's plunge , plus any further damage that *T* might occur early this week , as a chance for bargain hunting . 
`` There has been a lot of emotional selling that *T* presents a nice buying opportunity if you 've got the cash , '' says *T* Stephen B. <unk> , chief investment officer of Chicago-based Kemper Financial Services <unk> . 
But most advisers think 0 the immediate course for individual investors should be * to stand * <unk> . 
`` When you see a <unk> train , '' says *T* Steve <unk> , partner in the San Francisco investment advisory firm <unk> & <unk> , `` you wait for the train to stop . '' 
Even for people who *T* expect a bear market in coming months -- and a sizable number of money managers and market <unk> do *?* -- the advice is : * <unk> for the market to <unk> back , and sell shares gradually during rallies . 
The best thing 0 individual investors can do *T* is * `` just sit tight , '' says *T* Marshall B. Front , executive vice president and head of investment counseling at Stein <unk> & <unk> Inc. , a Chicago-based investment counseling firm that *T* manages about $ 18 billion *U* . 
On the one hand , Mr. Front says 0 *T* , it <unk> would be <unk> * to sell into `` a classic panic . '' 
On the other hand , it 's not necessarily a good time 0 * to jump in and buy *T* . 
`` This is all <unk> right now , and when <unk> starts * to run *T* , it can run further than anyone anticipates , '' he said *T* . 
`` So it <unk> 's more prudent * to wait and see how things stabilize *T* . '' 
Roger <unk> , professor of finance at Yale University and head of the market information firm <unk> Associates Inc. , says , `` My real advice would be * to just ride through it . 
Generally , it is n't wise * to be in <unk> and out '' of <unk> the stock market . 
Mr. <unk> thinks that this week is `` going * to be a <unk> week . '' 
But he also thinks 0 it is `` a good week 0 * to consider * buying *T* . '' 
John Snyder , former president of the Los Angeles chapter of the National Association of Investors Corp. , an organization of investment clubs and individual investors , says 0 his fellow club members did n't sell in the crash of 1987 , and see no reason 0 * to sell now *T* . 
`` We 're dedicated long-term investors , not traders , '' he says *T* . 
`` We understand <unk> and <unk> . 
And we hope * to take advantage of <unk> and buy stocks when they plunge *T* . '' 
One camp of investment <unk> sees what *T* happened Friday as an opportunity . 
Over the next days and weeks , they say 0 *T* , investors should look for stocks 0 * to buy *T* . 
Friday 's action `` was an old-fashioned panic , '' says 0 *T* Alfred Goldman , director of technical market analysis for A.G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis . 
`` Stocks were being thrown * out of windows at any price . '' 
His advice : `` You ought * to be there with a basket * catching them . '' 
James Craig , portfolio manager for the Denver-based <unk> Fund , which *T* has one of the industry 's better track records , started his buying during Friday 's plunge . 
Stocks such as <unk> Foods Corp. , Wal-Mart Stores Inc. , American International Group Inc. and Federal National Mortgage Association became such bargains that he could n't resist them , he says 0 *T* . 
And Mr. Craig expects * to pick up more shares today . 
`` It will be <unk> at first , but I would not be buying if I thought 0 we were headed * for real trouble , '' he says *T* . 
He argues that stocks are reasonably valued * now , and that interest rates are lower <unk> now than in the fall of 1987 . 
Mr. Front of Stein <unk> suggests that any buying should `` concentrate in stocks that *T* have lagged the market on the up side , or stocks that *T* have been beaten * down a lot more than the market in this correction . '' 
His firm favors selected computer , drug and <unk> stocks . 
Other investment <unk> are more pessimistic . 
They say 0 investors should sell stocks -- but not necessarily right away . 
Many of them stress that the selling can be orderly , gradual , and done when stock prices are <unk> *T* . 
On Thursday , William <unk> , a Seattle money manager , used futures contracts in his personal account * to place a bet that the broad market averages would decline . 
He thinks 0 the underlying inflation rate is around 5 % to 6 % *U* , far higher than most people <unk> . 
In the pension accounts 0 he manages *T* , Mr. <unk> has raised cash positions and invested in gold <unk> and natural gas <unk> stocks , partly as an inflation hedge . 
He thinks 0 government officials are <unk> * to let a recession start when government , corporate and personal debt levels are so high *T* . 
So he thinks 0 the government will <unk> on the side of <unk> inflation . 
As a result , Mr. <unk> says 0 *T* , `` I think 0 the ball game 's over , '' and investors are about * to face a bear market . 
David M. Jones , vice president at <unk> G. <unk> & Co. , recommends Treasury securities -LRB- of up to five years ' maturity -RRB- . 
He says 0 the Oct. 6 employment report , showing slower economic growth and a severe weakening in the manufacturing sector , is a warning sign to investors . 
One strategy for investors who *T* want * to stay in but hedge their bets is * to buy `` put '' options , either on the individual stocks 0 they own *T* or on a broad market index . 
A put option gives its holder the right -LRB- but not the obligation -RRB- * to sell a stock -LRB- or stock index -RRB- for a specified price -LRB- the strike price -RRB- until the option expires . 
Whether this insurance is <unk> depends on the cost of an option . 
The cost , or premium , tends * to get fat in times of crisis . 
Thus , * buying puts after a big market slide can be an expensive way 0 * to hedge against risk *T* . 
The prices of puts generally did n't soar Friday . 
For example , the premium as a percentage of the stock price for certain puts on Eli Lilly & Co. moved up from 3 % at Thursday 's close to only 3.3 % at Friday 's close , even though the shares dropped more than $ <unk> *U* . 
But <unk> prices may <unk> when trading <unk> today *T* . 
It <unk> 's hard * to <unk> about a reasonable price for puts . 
But investors should keep in mind , before * paying too much , that the average annual return for stock holdings , long-term , is 9 % to 10 % *U* a year ; a return of 15 % is considered * <unk> . 
* <unk> , say , 10 % for insurance against losses takes a deep bite out of the return . 
James A. White and Tom <unk> contributed to this article . 
<unk> <unk> Commercial Group said 0 it sold $ 47 million *U* of common stock to its employees at $ 10 *U* a share , * giving them a total stake of more than 40 % in the commercial real estate brokerage firm . 
The firm , which *T* was acquired * in April from Sears , Roebuck & Co. in a management-led buy-out , had planned * to sell up to $ <unk> million *U* of stock , or a 50 % stake in the company , to its 5,000 employees . 
Though the offering did n't sell out , James J. <unk> , chairman and chief executive officer , said , `` We 're pretty proud of the employees ' response . '' 
He noted that unlike an employee stock ownership plan , where a company usually <unk> money from third party lenders * to buy stock that it sets *T* aside * to award employees over time *T* , here employees had * to <unk> out their own cash for the stock . 
`` They came up with their own money instead of borrowed money , '' Mr. <unk> said *T* . 
`` It 's totally different . '' 
He said 0 the offering was designed * to create long-term incentives for employees . 
`` We 're in a service business , and in that context , it <unk> 's vital * to have your employees involved in the ownership so they have a stake in the success . '' 
The brokerage firm <unk> n't pay a dividend on the stock . 
Employees have the right * to trade stock among themselves , and the company will establish an internal clearing house for these transactions . 
They may also eventually sell the shares to third parties , but the outside investors who *T* own the remaining 60 % of <unk> <unk> have the right to first refusal . 
Those outside investors in <unk> <unk> include <unk> Group , a closely held Washington , D.C. , merchant banking firm whose co-chairman *T* is Frank Carlucci , former secretary of defense ; <unk> V. <unk> , senior adviser to <unk> Group ; Mellon Family Trust of Pittsburgh ; Westinghouse Credit Corp. , the financial services unit of Westinghouse Electric Corp. ; Bankers Trust Co. , a unit of Bankers Trust New York Corp. ; and a group of Japanese investors represented * by the investment banking unit of <unk> Sumitomo Bank . 
Bankers Trust and Sumitomo financed the $ 300 million *U* acquisition from Sears Roebuck . 
<unk> <unk> also named three outside director nominees for its 17 member board . 
The nominees are Gary Wilson , chief financial officer of Walt Disney Co. ; James Montgomery , chief executive officer of Great Western Financial Corp. ; and Peter <unk> , former commissioner of baseball and now a private investor . 
The first major event this morning in U.S. stock and futures trading may be a <unk> at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange . 
Under a reform arising from the 1987 crash , trading in the Merc 's stock-index futures will break for 10 minutes if the contract opens and stays five points from Friday 's close , a move equal to 40 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average . 
The aim of the <unk> would be * to ease the opening of the New York Stock Exchange , which *T* would be <unk> * by such a volatile move on the Merc . 
That <unk> <unk> is just one of a number of <unk> adopted * after the 1987 crash . 
The Big Board also added computer capacity * to handle huge <unk> in trading volume . 
Several of those post-crash changes <unk> in during Friday 's <unk> collapse and worked as * expected , even though they did n't prevent a stunning plunge . 
But the major `` circuit <unk> '' have yet * to be <unk> * . 
A deeper market plunge today could give them their first test . 
A further slide also would <unk> debate over a host of other , more sweeping changes proposed -- but not implemented -- after the last crash . 
Most notably , several of the regulatory steps recommended * by the Brady <unk> Force , which *T* <unk> the 1987 crash , would be revived * -- especially because that group 's chairman is now the Treasury secretary . 
The most controversial of the Brady recommendations involved * establishing a single <unk> regulator * to handle crucial <unk> questions , such as * setting consistent margin requirements for the stock and futures markets . 
But for the moment , attention focuses on the reforms that *T* were put * into place , and market regulators and participants said 0 the circuit <unk> worked as * intended . 
Big Board and Merc officials expressed satisfaction with the results of two limits imposed * on of the Merc 's Standard & Poor 's 500 contract , as well as `` <unk> '' communications among exchanges . 
Those <unk> -- from <unk> p.m. to <unk> p.m. <unk> and from <unk> p.m. until the close of trading a half-hour later -- forced traders to buy and sell contracts at prices at <unk> or higher than <unk> their frozen levels . 
During the first halt , after the S&P index had fallen 12 points , the Big Board 's `` <unk> '' computer program automatically was triggered * . 
That system is designed * * to separate <unk> program trades from all other trades * to help exchange officials resolve order imbalances in individual stocks . 
One Merc broker compared the action in the S&P pit during the two <unk> to a fire at a <unk> school . 
`` You do n't want the fire but you know what * to do *T* , '' said *T* Howard <unk> , an independent floor broker and a Merc governor . 
`` There was no panic . 
The system worked the way 0 we devised it to work *T* . '' 
After * <unk> for about 15 minutes , the S&P index tumbled to its <unk> limit and the second freeze went into effect . 
Traders then spent the last half-hour * `` watching * to see if the Dow would drop 250 points , '' Mr. <unk> added 0 *T* , * referring to the level at which the stock market itself would have closed for an hour *T* . 
One <unk> estimated that 80 % to 90 % *U* of the S&P traders `` were just standing around * watching . '' 
But the <unk> circuit <unk> never had * to kick in , and <unk> on the Chicago Board of Trade 's Major Market Index also were n't triggered * . 
The <unk> and the S&P 500 are the two major indexes used * by program traders * to run their computerized trading strategies . 
The programs are considered by many * to be a major cause of the 1987 crash . 
The process of post-crash reforms began with calls 0 *T* to <unk> the markets and wound up a year later with a series of rather technical adjustments . 
In October 1987 , just after the market drop , Washington was <unk> in talk of sweeping changes in the way 0 the financial markets are structured and regulated *T* . 
Over the next year that grand agenda was <unk> * down to a series of steps 0 * to <unk> big stock drops by * <unk> trading * to give market players time 0 * to <unk> and reconsider positions *T* *T* . 
In addition , limits were placed * on <unk> trading , and steps were taken * * to better link the stock and futures markets . 
Few changes were made * in the way 0 the markets are regulated * *T* . 
At the <unk> the prime target was program trading , which *T* was much discussed but little understood on Capitol Hill . 
There were also calls 0 * to strip the stock markets of `` <unk> '' products , such as stock-index futures and options , which Federal Judge Stanley <unk> , for example , <unk> *T* to `` <unk> attached to the basic market *T* . '' 
And there was much criticism of the New York Stock Exchange 's system of * having stock trades flow through specialists , or market makers . 
When the Brady <unk> Force 's powerful analysis of the crash was released * in January 1988 *T* , it immediately <unk> the <unk> ' agenda . 
* <unk> that the separate financial <unk> acted as one , and <unk> that the crash had `` raised the possibility of a <unk> financial system breakdown , '' the presidential task force called for * establishing a <unk> * to oversee the markets , * to make margins consistent across markets , * to <unk> clearing systems and * to install circuit <unk> . 
Only the last of those recommendations ever was implemented * . 
The Reagan White House held the Brady recommendations at arm 's length and named a second panel -- the Working Group on the Financial Markets -- to review its analysis and those of other crash studies . 
In May 1988 , the Working Group , made up of representatives from the Federal Reserve , the Treasury , the Securities and Exchange Commission , and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , finally endorsed only circuit <unk> . 
After several more months of arguments among various stock exchanges and futures markets , circuit <unk> were set * in place , with the most notable <unk> trading after 250 and 400 point drops in the Dow Jones Industrial Average . 
<unk> , some free <unk> dismissed such mechanisms as <unk> to <unk> . 
After all , this free-market argument went 0 *T* , the Dow only dropped more than 250 points once this century . 
`` Circuit <unk> '' set * * to <unk> big drops : 
-- If S&P futures fall 5 points at opening , contract trading <unk> for 10 minutes . 
-- If Dow <unk> fall 25 points at opening , contract trading <unk> for 10 minutes . 
-- If S&P futures fall 12 points -LRB- equivalent to about 100 points on <unk> -RRB- , trading is frozen * for half hour to that price or higher . 
On <unk> program trades are diverted * into a separate computer file * to determine buy and sell orders . 
-- If S&P futures fall 30 points , trading is restricted * for an hour to that price or higher . 
-- If Dow <unk> fall 250 points , trading on the Big Board <unk> for an hour . 
S&P and <unk> contracts also halt . 
-- If <unk> drops 400 points , Big Board <unk> trading for two hours . 
Trading in <unk> and S&P futures also halted . 
Brady <unk> Force recommendations -LRB- Jan. 1988 -RRB- : 
-- * <unk> an <unk> regulator for financial markets

-- * <unk> margins consistent across stock and futures markets 
SEC proposals -LRB- May 1988 -RRB- :

Congressional proposal : 
-- * <unk> a task force 0 *T* to review current state of the securities markets and securities laws . 
* <unk> the Soviet government 's television monopoly , an independent company has gained rights * to show world programming , including American films . 
`` There must not be a monopoly , there must be freedom of choice for both journalists and viewers , '' <unk> I. <unk> , the president of the <unk> TV company , told the weekly newspaper <unk> *T* . 
The company is already working on its own programming in several provincial cities and hopes * to be on the air regularly in about a year , the newspaper said 0 *T* . 
Mr. <unk> told <unk> that he recently had been to the U.S. * to pick up the rights * to show 5,000 U.S. films in the Soviet Union . 
<unk> 's article was accompanied * by a picture of Mr. <unk> <unk> singer John Denver in Colorado . 
Even though it will be independent of official television , <unk> will have an oversight board that *T* will include members of the Communist youth league . 
South Africa 's National Union of <unk> said that about 10,000 diamond miners struck for higher wages at De <unk> Consolidated Mines Ltd. 
De <unk> said that workers at five of the group 's mines were on strike , which it said 0 *T* was peaceful , with orderly <unk> occurring at one of the mines . 
The <unk> in negotiations occurred with De <unk> offering a 17 % increase in the <unk> category while the union demanded a <unk> % increase in the minimum wage . 
Japan 's opposition Socialist Party denied that its legislators had been <unk> * by <unk> owners . 
The <unk> had been raised * in Parliament by the governing Liberal Democratic Party following magazine reports suggesting that money from <unk> <unk> , called * <unk> , had <unk> politics . 
<unk> <unk> , secretary general of the Socialist Party , acknowledged that nine party lawmakers had received donations from the <unk> association totaling 8 million yen -LRB- about $ <unk> *U* -RRB- but said 0 the donations were legal and none of its members acted * to favor the industry . 
The World <unk> Fund for <unk> said that Spain , Argentina , Thailand and Indonesia were doing too little 0 *T* to prevent illegal trade in <unk> wildlife across their borders . 
A report by the conservation group presented * at the <unk> Convention on International Trade in <unk> <unk> in <unk> accused the four of * trading protected species ranging from <unk> to <unk> . 
Fund official Simon <unk> said 0 world trade in wildlife was estimated * to total $ 5 billion *U* of business annually . 
A NATO project 0 *T* to build a <unk> for the 1990s was <unk> * by the <unk> of three of its eight participating nations . 
Britain , France and Italy announced technical reasons for withdrawing , but some officials pointed to growing reluctance <unk> among the allies * to commit themselves to big defense spending while <unk> <unk> talks show signs of success . 
Small wonder that Britain 's Labor Party wants credit controls . 
A few hours after the party launched its own <unk> credit card earlier this month , the <unk> raised the nation 's base interest rate . 
Labor 's Visa card is believed * to be the first linked * to a British political party . 
Labor gets 25 pence -LRB- 39 cents -RRB- for every 100 -LRB- about $ 155 *U* -RRB- that a user charges *T* to the card . 
As with other plastic in Britain 's <unk> environment , the Labor card , <unk> * by <unk> Bank , carries a stiff -LRB- in this case , <unk> % -RRB- annual rate on the unpaid balance . 
China 's <unk> austerity program has achieved some successes in * <unk> <unk> economic growth and stabilizing prices but has failed * to eliminate serious defects in state planning and an <unk> drain on state budgets . 
The official China Daily said 0 retail prices of <unk> foods have n't risen since last December but acknowledged 0 that huge government subsidies were a main factor in * keeping prices down . 
The State <unk> Bureau found that more than 1 billion <unk> -LRB- $ 270 million *U* -RRB- was spent * in the first half of the year for pork subsidies . 
The newspaper quoted experts as * saying 0 the subsidies would cause the difference between prices and real values of commodities to `` become very <unk> '' and reduce needed funds for investment in the `` already difficult state budget . '' 
The aim of the austerity measures was * to <unk> economic growth , which *T* soared to <unk> % last year , to 8 % in 1990 . 
Economists now predict 0 the growth rate will be about 11.5 % for the year . 
In a sign of growing official <unk> for religion , Russian <unk> <unk> were allowed * to <unk> the <unk> anniversary of the Moscow <unk> in the Kremlin 's <unk> <unk> <unk> , where <unk> were <unk> * *T* <unk> . 
A <unk> , $ 7.7 million *U* <unk> of <unk> was completed * on a <unk> outside Hong Kong , facing China . 
The <unk> is the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> , director of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , who *T* said : `` Hong Kong is such a <unk> place , 0 we also need some kind of religious symbol . 
It all seemed innocent enough : Last April , one Steven B. <unk> visited <unk> Products Inc. here , identified himself as a potential customer and got the word on the little company 's new <unk> players for children . 
`` It is almost identical to the Sony product , '' Mr. <unk> <unk> *T* , after * seeing <unk> and pictures . 
<unk> a <unk> salesman : `` <unk> . '' 
The <unk> merchandise carried wholesale prices some 40 % below those of Sony Corp. of Japan 's `` My First Sony '' line . 
The visitor <unk> * enthusiastic and promised * to return . 
But instead of a new customer -- part of a <unk> <unk> from * <unk> Sony -- <unk> got a costly legal <unk> *T* . 
Mr. <unk> , it turned out *T* , was a private <unk> using a hidden tape <unk> * to gather information for Sony . 
His recording later turned up as a court exhibit . 
* <unk> * to keep <unk> 's `` My <unk> '' product line off the U.S. market , Sony last May filed a suit <unk> in Manhattan federal court accusing the <unk> of trademark infringement , unfair competition and other violations of business law . 
Since then , life has changed a lot for <unk> Leonard <unk> , <unk> 's owner . 
`` I have n't been able * to get a decent night 's sleep since this has been going on , '' he says *T* . 
`` It 's the most <unk> thing in my life -- I <unk> n't even attend to my business . '' 
His company -LRB- annual sales : about $ 25 million *U* -RRB- may suffer a costly blow -- * losing an estimated 10 % of total sales -- if Sony -LRB- annual sales : about $ 16 billion *U* -RRB- <unk> . 
<unk> 's plight shows what *T* can happen when a tiny company suddenly faces the full legal might of a <unk> multinational . 
With considerable irony , the case also shows how completely Japan has turned the tables on U.S. business *T* . 
Americans used * to complain bitterly about * being <unk> by <unk> products from Japan . 
Now Sony , whose innovative , <unk> products *T* are among the most <unk> in consumer electronics , is bitterly complaining about a little U.S. firm with a cheap <unk> produced * in China . 
`` The <unk> of this is that <unk> knocked off the Sony line and Sony wants * to stop it , '' says *T* Lewis H. <unk> , Sony 's attorney , who *T* previously <unk> <unk> 's <unk> . 
-LRB- Sony itself declines * to comment . -RRB- 
If Sony wins , Mr. <unk> says , its little rival will have * to try * to sell the products overseas . 
At worst , he adds *T* , `` They 'd have * to <unk> them all up and throw them away . '' 
Mr. <unk> denies the suit 's charges and says 0 his only mistake was * taking on Sony in the marketplace . 
`` I made a similar line and I produced it cheaper , '' he says *T* . 
Today , U.S. Judge John E. <unk> is expected * to rule on Sony 's renewed request for a <unk> order blocking sale of the disputed products , on which deliveries began in July *T* . 
The judge turned down an earlier Sony request for such an order -- a decision upheld * on appeal -- but Sony returned with additional evidence and arguments . 
Though * hoping * to settle the case , <unk> <unk> * to fight on , if necessary . 
But the battle is more than <unk> <unk> for *?* . 
`` I had no idea 0 I was getting in so deep , '' says *T* Mr. <unk> , who *T* founded <unk> in 1982 . 
Mr. <unk> had sold <unk> Inc. , a Taiwan electronics maker , and retired , only * to find 0 he was <unk> . 
With <unk> , he began * selling toys and electronics made * mostly in Hong Kong , * beginning with <unk> <unk> <unk> . 
The company has grown -- to about 40 employees , from four initially , Mr. <unk> says *T* . 
<unk> has been profitable since 1986 , adds 0 *T* the official , who *T* shares his office with numerous <unk> bears , all samples from his line of <unk> toys . 
Like many others , Mr. <unk> took notice in 1987 when Sony , in a classic example of market <unk> , changed the plastic skin and <unk> on the famous <unk> line of portable audio equipment and created the My First Sony line for children . 
The <unk> <unk> new products looked more like toys than the adult models . 
-LRB- In court papers , Sony says 0 it has spent more than $ 3 million *U* * to promote the line , with resulting sales of over a million units . -RRB- 
Sony found a new market niche , but Mr. <unk> figured that its prices left plenty of room for a <unk> competitor . 
His products are n't exact copies of Sony 's but strongly <unk> them in size , shape and , especially , color . 
Sony uses mostly red and blue , with <unk> of yellow -- and so does <unk> , on the theory that kids prefer these colors . 
-LRB- `` * To be successful , a product can be any color <unk> , as long as it is <unk> red , '' says *T* Charles E. <unk> , <unk> 's attorney . -RRB- 
By last winter , <unk> was showing <unk> at toy <unk> in Hong Kong and New York -- and Sony noticed . 
Indeed , * concerned that Sony sales personnel were threatening legal action or other retaliation -- such as * withholding desirable Sony products -- against <unk> 's customers , Mr. <unk> fired off a letter to Sony in April . 
He himself threatened * to take the matter to the Federal Trade Commission or U.S. Justice Department . 
But <unk> has n't pursued those charges -LRB- which *T* were without merit , according to Mr. <unk> , the Sony attorney -RRB- . 
<unk> Mr. <unk> : `` Our purpose was * to influence them to leave us alone . 
We never intended * taking on Sony -- we do n't have the resources . '' 
Sony answered the empty threat with its real suit . 
<unk> and on since then , the companies have <unk> in court . 
And <unk> , in a news release , says , `` * Once competitive , Sony now <unk> to <unk> tactics in American <unk> * to <unk> out <unk> and protect <unk> niche markets . '' 
Sony 's lawyer insists that the company 's tactics -- including the use of a private <unk> <unk> as a buyer -- are routine in such matters . 
He also insists that Sony , no less than others , has a legal right * to protect its `` trade dress , '' in this case , mostly the colors that it claims 0 *T* make My First Sony products <unk> . 
-LRB- <unk> claims 0 it began * using the same colors on electronic goods for children long before Sony entered the children 's market . -RRB- 
Whatever its merits , Sony 's aggressive defense is <unk> for <unk> . 
It 's also costly . 
Mr. <unk> says 0 he has paid more than $ 70,000 *U* in legal fees so far . 
Of Sony , Mr. <unk> says : `` They know 0 there 's no way 0 for them to lose *T* . 
They just keep * <unk> me in deeper until I reach the point where I give up and go away . '' 
For now , though , he <unk> * to hang in .

Both companies rejected the offers . 
Dresdner Bank AG of West Germany has announced a friendly tender offer for control of Banque <unk> de <unk> , a French bank whose main shareholder *T* is France 's Societe Generale , the Societe de <unk> <unk> said *T* . 
The tender offer by West Germany 's <unk> commercial bank is in two stages . 
Dresdner is offering * to acquire <unk> % of <unk> 's capital for <unk> francs -LRB- $ <unk> *U* -RRB- a share . 
The terms of the offer put a value of <unk> million francs -LRB- $ <unk> million *U* -RRB- on the <unk> % <unk> .

Giant has n't ever disclosed the proposed price , although <unk> Inc. , an <unk> , Va.-based aircraft consulting concern , has valued <unk> 's fleet at about $ 46 million *U* .

Both Paribas and <unk> have been increasing their stakes in <unk> <unk> recently for what they have termed *T* `` investment purposes , '' although the issue has been surrounded * by takeover speculation in recent weeks . 
<unk> did n't comment officially on its reasons for * seeking the approval , but people close to the group said 0 it was done * * to make sure 0 the group would have the flexibility 0 * to increase its stake in the future *T* , should interesting price opportunities arise . 
An <unk> official did specify , however , that there was no foundation to recent rumors 0 the group might be acting in concert with Paribas .

<unk> auto workers ended their <unk> occupation of a metal shop at a <unk> S.A. factory in eastern France Friday as pay talks got under way in the capital . 
But the <unk> breakthrough came as a nationwide dispute by Finance Ministry employees <unk> border <unk> and threatened the government 's ability * to pay its bills . 
The <unk> <unk> began * filing out of the shop , which *T* makes auto parts , at the plant in <unk> after * voting <unk> to <unk> * to abandon the occupation . 
Their withdrawal was based * on promises <unk> by <unk> * to open negotiations in Paris at the same time 0 the last man left the <unk> *T* . 
The strike by customs officers , tax collectors , treasury workers and other civil <unk> attached * to the Ministry of Finance may pose a more serious challenge to the government and the average <unk> . 
Ministry employees complain that they are poorly paid * because of a complex <unk> system 0 they say 0 *T* fails * to take into account their education and level of technical expertise . 
The market for $ 200 billion *U* of high-risk junk bonds , * battered * by a succession of <unk> and huge price declines this year , practically <unk> Friday . 
Trading ground to a halt as investors rushed * to sell bonds , only * to find themselves <unk> * by potential buyers . 
* <unk> , they watched brokerage houses mark down price quotations on their junk holdings while * being able * to <unk> very few actual trades . 
`` The junk bond market is in a state of <unk> now -- there are no bids , only offers , '' says *T* independent investor Martin D. <unk> , who *T* manages nearly $ 4 billion *U* and who *T* recently decided * to buy <unk> securities for a new fund . 
This <unk> is `` far from over , '' he says 0 *T* . 
<unk> 's collapse helped * <unk> the <unk> selling of stocks that *T* produced the <unk> one-day <unk> in the Dow Jones Industrial Average since the Oct. 19 , 1987 , crash . 
<unk> , it also helped * trigger this year 's biggest rally in the U.S. government bond market as investors rushed * to move capital into the <unk> securities 0 they could find *T* . 
But `` an <unk> silence <unk> '' the junk market Friday as prices tumbled on hundreds of high-yield bonds despite `` no active trading , '' says *T* John <unk> , an economist at Moody 's Investors Service <unk> . 
For example , the price of Southland Corp. 's $ 500 million *U* of 16 <unk> % bonds due <unk> -- sold less than two years ago by Goldman , Sachs & Co. -- plummeted 25 % to just 30 cents on the dollar . 
But not even Goldman would make a market in the securities of Southland , the owner of the nationwide chain of <unk> convenience stores that *T* is <unk> * for cash . 
Goldman officials declined * to comment . 
<unk> bonds , which *T* <unk> from less than $ 2 billion *U* at the start of this decade , have been declining for months as issuer after issuer sank beneath the weight of hefty interest payments . 
The shaky market received its biggest <unk> last month from Campeau Corp. , which *T* created its U.S. retailing empire with junk financing . 
Campeau developed a cash squeeze that *T* caused it to be <unk> on some interest payments and to put its prestigious <unk> <unk> chain up for sale . 
Now , dozens of corporations , including <unk> Allen , <unk> Services and York International , that *T* are counting on at least $ 7 billion *U* of scheduled new junk <unk> * to keep their highly leveraged takeovers and buy-outs <unk> , may never get the money . 
`` The music has stopped * playing , '' says *T* Michael <unk> , a principal in the investment firm of Levy <unk> . 
`` You 've either got a chair or you do n't *?* . '' 
In Friday 's aftermath , says 0 *T* R. Douglas <unk> , a director of high-yield finance at First Boston Corp. , `` much of the $ 7 billion *U* forward calendar could be deferred * , depending on the <unk> . '' 
In August , First Boston withdrew a $ <unk> million *U* junk offering of Ohio <unk> bonds because potential buyers were `` very <unk> . '' 
The outlook `` looks shaky because we 're still waiting '' for mutual funds , in particular , to dump some of their junk bond holdings * to pay off redemptions by individual investors , says 0 *T* King <unk> , senior vice president at McCarthy , <unk> & <unk> , an investment arm of Xerox Financial Services . 
Indeed , a Moody 's index that *T* tracks the net asset values of 24 high-yield mutual funds declined for the <unk> consecutive day Friday . 
In a <unk> contrast , the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond climbed more than 2 <unk> points , or about $ 25 *U* for each $ 1,000 *U* face amount , to 103 <unk> , its biggest gain of the year . 
The bond 's yield dropped to <unk> % , the lowest since March 31 , 1987 , according to Technical Data Global Markets Group . 
The yield on three-month Treasury bills , considered the <unk> of all investments , plummeted about 0.7 percentage point to <unk> % , the largest one-day decline since 1982 . 
The main <unk> for government bond market rally was the <unk> drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average . 
`` When you get panic in one market *T* , you get flight to quality in the other , '' said *T* <unk> <unk> , money market economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert <unk> . 
Nevertheless , the problems of the junk market could prompt the Federal Reserve to ease credit in the months ahead . 
`` This marks a significant shift in the interest rate outlook , '' says *T* William Sullivan , director of money market research at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. , New York . 
Any sustained <unk> could be a lift for junk bonds as well as other securities . 
Robert Dow , a partner and portfolio manager at Lord , <unk> & Co. , which *T* manages $ 4 billion *U* of high-yield bonds , says 0 he does n't `` think 0 there is any fundamental economic <unk> -LCB- for the junk bond <unk> -RCB- . 
It was <unk> <unk> . '' 
He adds : `` The junk market has <unk> some trouble and now some people think that if the equity market gets <unk> * that means 0 the economy will be terrible and that 's bad for junk . 
I do n't believe 0 that 's the case , but I believe that people are running * scared . 
There is a flight to quality , and the quality is not in equities and not in junk -- it 's in Treasurys . '' 
Even as trading in high-yield issues <unk> up over the past month , corporations sold more than $ 2 billion *U* of new junk bonds . 
For example , a recent $ <unk> million *U* offering of <unk> Gas Services L.P. bonds sold * by First Boston was three times <unk> . 
A $ 550 million *U* offering of Turner Broadcasting System <unk> . high-yield securities sold last week by Drexel was increased * $ 50 million *U* because of strong demand . 
First Boston estimates that in November and December alone , junk bond investors will receive $ 4.8 billion *U* of coupon interest payments . 
`` That 's a clear indication that there is <unk> and will be <unk> an <unk> of basic business going on , '' says *T* Mr. <unk> of First Boston . 
`` I do n't know how people can say 0 the junk bond market disappeared *T* when there were $ 1.5 billion *U* of orders for $ 550 million *U* of junk bonds sold last week by Turner *T* , '' says *T* Raymond <unk> , <unk> of merchant banking at Merrill Lynch & <unk> . 
`` When the rally comes *T* , insurance companies will be leading it because they have billions 0 * to invest *T* and invest they will *T* . 
There is plenty of money available from people who *T* want * to buy <unk> deals ; it <unk> 's the stuff that *T* 's financed on a <unk> that people are wary of *T* . '' 
But such highly leveraged transactions seemed * to have <unk> this year , * casting a <unk> over much of the junk market . 
Michael <unk> , director of fixed-income research at Kemper Financial Services , says 0 the quality of junk issues has been getting <unk> , * contributing to the slide in prices . 
`` Last year we probably bought one out of every three new deals , '' he says *T* . 
`` This year , at best , it 's in one in every five or six . 
And our credit standards have n't changed one <unk> . '' 
However , Mr. <unk> said 0 the slide in junk is creating `` one hell of a buying opportunity '' for selective buyers . 
For the moment , investors seem more <unk> with the `` bad '' junk than the `` good '' junk . 
`` The market has been weak since '' the announcement of the Campeau cash squeeze and the company 's subsequent bailout by Olympia & York , says *T* Mr. <unk> of Merrill Lynch . 
`` That really affected the market in that people started * to ask <unk> What else *T* is in trouble ? ' '' 
Well before Campeau , though , there were signs that the junk market was <unk> through one of its worst years ever . 
Despite the relatively strong economy , junk bond prices did nothing except go down , * <unk> by a seemingly <unk> trail of bad news : 
-- In June , two months before it would default on interest payments covering some of its $ 1.2 billion *U* of speculative debt securities , New York-based Integrated Resources Inc. said 0 it ran out of borrowed money . 
-- In July , Southmark Corp. , the Dallas-based real estate and financial services company with about $ 1.3 billion *U* of junk bonds , voluntarily filed for protection under U.S. bankruptcy law . 
-- By the end of July , the difference in yield between an index of junk bonds and seven-year Treasury notes widened to more than 5.5 percentage points . 
-- In August , Resorts International Inc. , which *T* sold more than $ 500 million *U* of junk bonds , suspended interest payments . 
-- In September , just as the cash squeeze hit Campeau , Lomas Financial Corp. defaulted on $ 145 million *U* of notes and appeared unlikely * to pay interest on a total of $ 1.2 billion *U* of debt securities . 
<unk> , regulators are becoming increasingly worried as the rush to leverage shows no signs of * <unk> . 
Moody 's says 0 the <unk> of corporate credit <unk> is the highest this year since 1982 . 
In addition , there are six times as many troubled banks as there were in the recession of 1981 , according to the Federal Deposit Insurance <unk> . 
`` The era of the 1980s is about compound interest and the reaching for it , '' says *T* James Grant , editor of Grant 's Interest <unk> <unk> , an early critic of the junk bond market . 
`` What we 've begun * to see *T* is the damage to businesses of * paying <unk> compound interest . 
<unk> were borrowing at interest rates higher than their own earnings . 
What we 're seeing *T* now is the <unk> <unk> of asset values to a future when <unk> debt will be hard * to obtain rather than easy *?* *T* . '' 
Friday 's Market <unk> 
Prices of Treasury bonds surged in the biggest rally of the year as investors fled a <unk> stock market . 
The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was quoted * 6 p.m. EDT at 103 <unk> , compared * with 100 <unk> Thursday , up 2 <unk> points . 
The yield on the benchmark fell to <unk> % , the lowest since March 31 , 1987 , according to Technical Data Global Markets Group . 
The `` flight to quality '' began late in the day and followed a <unk> fall in the stock market . 
Treasurys opened lower , * <unk> <unk> to news that the producer price index -- a measure of inflation on the wholesale level -- accelerated in September . 
Bond prices barely <unk> until midday . 
Many bond market participants will be closely <unk> the action of the Federal Reserve , which *T* might repeat its October 1987 <unk> of huge amounts of liquidity * to <unk> the financial markets and keep the economy from * slowing into a recession . 
Prices of <unk> , <unk> <unk> and mortgage-backed bonds also rose , but lagged behind their Treasury counterparts . 
Mortgage securities rose in <unk> trading , with most of the activity concentrated in Government National Mortgage Association 9 % coupon securities , the most liquid mortgage issue . 
The Ginnie Mae November 9 % issue ended at 98 <unk> , up <unk> point on the day , * to yield about <unk> % to a <unk> average life assumption . 
<unk> corporate bonds were up about <unk> to <unk> point . 
But the yield spread between <unk> , <unk> issues and <unk> bonds widened . 
And the yields on telephone and utility issues rose relative to other <unk> bonds in anticipation of this week 's $ 3 billion *U* bond offering by the Tennessee Valley Authority . 
Despite rumors that the <unk> 's long-awaited offering would be postponed * because of the debacle in the equity markets , sources in the underwriting syndicate said 0 they expect 0 the issue will be priced * as * scheduled . 
One of the sources said 0 the smaller portions of $ 750 million *U* each of five-year and 10-year bonds have already been `` substantially <unk> * . '' 
Municipal bonds rose as much as <unk> point . 
Roger <unk> contributed to this article . 
Friday 's <unk> plunge in stocks does not come <unk> the climate of anxiety that *T* dominated financial markets just prior to their 1987 October crash , and mechanisms have been put * in place * to keep markets more orderly . 
Still , the lesson is about the same : On Friday the <unk> , the market was <unk> * by Washington . 
The consensus along the street seems * to be that the plunge was triggered * by the financing problems of the UAL takeover , and it 's certainly true 0 the <unk> began immediately after the UAL trading halt . 
Still , the consensus <unk> seems almost as wide that one <unk> bid is no reason 0 * to write down the value of all U.S. business *T* . 
This <unk> leads us to another piece of news moving on the Dow Jones <unk> shortly before the downturn : the success of Senate Democrats in * <unk> the capital gains tax cut . 
The real value of all shares , after all , is directly <unk> * by the tax on any profits -LRB- all the more so given the limits on deductions for losses that *T* show 0 gains are not `` ordinary income '' -RRB- . 
And market expectations clearly have been raised * by the capital gains victory in the House last month . 
An hour before Friday 's plunge , that provision was stripped * from the tax bill , * leaving it with $ 5.4 billion *U* in tax increases without a capital gains cut . 
There is a great deal 0 *T* to be said * , * to be sure , for * <unk> the garbage out of the <unk> bill . 
It would be a good thing if Congress started * to decide issues <unk> on their individual merits without <unk> . 
For one thing , no one doubts that the capital gains cut would pass on an <unk> vote . 
Since Senate leaders have so far <unk> it up with <unk> <unk> , promises of a <unk> bill are suspect . 
<unk> so since President Bush has been weakened * by the Panama <unk> . 
To the extent that the UAL troubles contributed to the plunge , they are another instance of Washington 's <unk> <unk> . 
As the best opportunities for corporate restructurings are exhausted * of course , at some point the market will start * to reject them . 
But the airlines are <unk> a clear case , * given anti-takeover <unk> by Secretary of Transportation <unk> , who *T* <unk> * to believe 0 safety will be <unk> * if <unk> and British Airways own interests in companies that *T* fly airplanes . 
<unk> , Congress has started * to jump on the <unk> <unk> . 
James <unk> , the Minnesota Democrat who *T* chairs the Public Works and Transportation Committee 's aviation subcommittee , has put an <unk> takeover bill on <unk> speed so that it would be passed * in time * to affect the American and United Air Lines bids . 
It would give Mr. <unk> up to 50 days * to `` review '' any bid for 15 % or more of the voting stock of any U.S. carrier with revenues of $ 1 billion *U* or more . 
So the UAL deal has problems , and the market loses 190 points . 
<unk> , Mr. Secretary and Mr. <unk> . 
In the 1987 crash , * remember , the market was <unk> * by a Danny Rostenkowski proposal * to tax takeovers out of <unk> . 
Even more important , in our view , was *T* the Treasury 's threat * to <unk> the dollar . 
The Treasury is doing the same thing today ; <unk> , the dollar is not under <unk> pressure . 
Also , traders are in better shape <unk> <unk> today than in 1987 * to survive selling <unk> . 
They are better capitalized * . 
They are in less danger of * losing liquidity simply because of tape <unk> and clearing and settlement delays . 
The Fed promises any needed liquidity . 
The Big Board 's <unk> with the Chicago Board of Trade has improved ; it <unk> will be interesting * to learn if `` circuit <unk> '' prove * to be a good idea . 
In any event , some traders see stocks as <unk> today , unlike 1987 . 
There is nothing wrong with the market that *T* <unk> n't be <unk> * by a little <unk> and common sense in Washington . 
But on the bearish side , that may be too much 0 * to expect *T* . 
First Chicago Corp. posted a third-quarter loss of $ <unk> million *U* after * joining other big banks in * further adding to its reserves for losses on foreign loans . 
The parent company of First National Bank of Chicago , with $ 48 billion *U* in assets , said 0 it set aside $ 200 million *U* * to absorb losses on loans and investments in financially troubled countries . 
The addition , on top of two big 1987 additions to <unk> reserves , brings the reserve to a level equaling 79 % of medium-term and long-term loans outstanding to troubled nations . 
First Chicago since 1987 has reduced its loans to such nations to $ 1.7 billion *U* from $ 3 billion *U* . 
Despite this loss , First Chicago said 0 it does n't need * to sell stock * to raise capital . 
During the quarter , the company realized a pretax gain of $ <unk> million *U* from the sale of its First Chicago Investment <unk> unit . 
<unk> foreign exchange and bond trading profits dipped 24 % against last year 's third quarter , to $ <unk> million *U* from $ <unk> million *U* . 
<unk> from First Chicago 's venture capital unit , a big leveraged buy-out investor , rose 32 % to $ 34 million *U* from $ <unk> million *U* a year ago . 
Interest income and most fee income was strong . 
Greece 's second <unk> of general elections this year is slated * for Nov. 5 . 
For those hoping * to see a <unk> of political <unk> restored -- in view of Greece 's <unk> <unk> under <unk> <unk> and subsequent three-month <unk> with a <unk> coalition government -- there is but one bright sign : The scandals still <unk> former Prime Minister <unk> <unk> and his fallen socialist government are like flies <unk> around a <unk> <unk> . 
In the <unk> round of voting , <unk> gave no clear mandate to any single political party . 
The ad interim coalition government that *T* emerged from <unk> <unk> was , in essence , little more than the <unk> <unk> of ideological <unk> : On one side , the <unk> New <unk> Party , headed * by <unk> <unk> . 
On the other , the so-called <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> -- a <unk> and rather <unk> title for a merger of the <unk> Communist Party of Greece and its <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> . 
The <unk> bond for this <unk> <unk> was plain : <unk> -LRB- Mr. <unk> 's party -RRB- as common political enemy . 
The <unk> goal was a <unk> of government corruption , <unk> at all levels , but the main marks were Mr. <unk> and his closest associates . 
In point of fact , this <unk> was overdue by decades . 
When * reduced to <unk> status in <unk> <unk> <unk> *T* , however , the notion <unk> into a promised assault , with targets primarily for political gains , not justice . 
With regard to Greece 's <unk> <unk> scandal , Mr. <unk> 's principal <unk> remains George <unk> , former owner of the Bank of <unk> and <unk> <unk> , now <unk> in a jail cell in <unk> , Mass. , from where he is fighting <unk> proceedings that *T* would return him to Greece *T* . 
Mr. <unk> 's credibility is , at best , <unk> . 
He has ample <unk> * to shift the blame , and his testimony has also been found * less than <unk> on numerous points . 
Nevertheless , the New <unk> and Communist parties <unk> his <unk> as proof of <unk> <unk> . 
Among <unk> questions are *T* whether Mr. <unk> received $ 23 million *U* of stolen Bank of <unk> funds and an additional $ <unk> *U* in <unk> , as * contended * ; whether the prime minister ordered state agencies * to deposit some $ 57 million *U* in Mr. <unk> 's bank and then <unk> off the interest ; and , what <unk> 's cut was *T* from the $ 210 million *U* 0 Mr. <unk> <unk> *T* . 
Two former ministers were so heavily implicated in the <unk> affair that <unk> members of Parliament voted * to refer them to the special court . 
But <unk> parliamentary probe was *T* the case of millions of <unk> 0 Mr. <unk> <unk> *T* into New <unk> <unk> . 
In the end , the investigation produced only <unk> evidence and `` indications '' that *T* point to <unk> , not <unk> proof . 
On another issue , <unk> were told * how their national intelligence agency , the <unk> , regularly <unk> the telephone conversations of prominent figures , including key opposition politicians , journalists and <unk> cabinet members . 
Despite convincing arguments , it was never established * that Mr. <unk> personally ordered or directed the <unk> . 
The central weakness of the `` scandals '' debates was pointed up especially well when discussions focused on arms deals and <unk> *T* . 
The coalition government tried * to show that <unk> ministers had received hefty sums for * <unk> the purchase of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> 2000 combat aircraft , produced * by the <unk> General Dynamics Corp. and France 's <unk> <unk> <unk> , respectively . 
<unk> , neither General Dynamics nor <unk> could be expected * to <unk> its prospective future dealings by * making disclosures of sums paid * -LRB- or not -RRB- to various Greek officials for services <unk> * . 
So it seems that Mr. <unk> and his communist <unk> may have <unk> served Mr. <unk> a moral victory on a <unk> : <unk> , whether guilty or not , can now <unk> the <unk> * <unk> the whole affair as a <unk> hunt at Mr. <unk> 's expense . 
But while <unk> high <unk> alone <unk> n't help <unk> regain power , Mr. <unk> should never be <unk> * . 
First came *T* his predictable <unk> : He charged 0 the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> had sold out its leftist <unk> by * <unk> in a right-wing plot aimed * at * <unk> <unk> and <unk> the course of socialism in Greece . 
Then , * to <unk> his credibility with the left , he <unk> some smaller leftist parties to stand for election under the <unk> <unk> . 
Next , he continued * to court the <unk> -- many of whom *T* feel <unk> by the <unk> coalition 's birth -- by * bringing into <unk> a <unk> Communist Party candidate . 
For balance , and in hopes of * gaining some <unk> <unk> votes , he managed * to attract a former New <unk> Party representative and known political enemy of Mr. <unk> . 
Thus <unk> heads for the polls not only with diminished <unk> , but also with `` <unk> of approval '' from representatives of its <unk> <unk> . 
<unk> as these elections are for Greece , pressing issues of state are getting lost in the <unk> . 
The country 's future NATO participation remains <unk> , for instance . 
Greece also must <unk> major pieces of legislation in preparation for the 1992 targets of heightened Common Market cooperation . 
Greece 's bilateral relations with the U.S. need attention soon as well . 
For one , the current accord concerning U.S. military bases in Greece <unk> in May 1990 . 
<unk> for a new agreement were frozen * before the June elections , but the clock is running . 
Another matter of concern is the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , a Palestinian terrorist who *T* is wanted * in the U.S. for the 1982 bombing of a Pan American Airways flight . 
The Greek courts have decided in favor of <unk> in the <unk> case , but the matter <unk> final approval from Greece 's next justice minister . 
The <unk> seem barely aware of the importance of the case as a <unk> test of whether Greece will be counted * in or out for international efforts * to combat terrorism . 
That <unk> could win the elections outright is <unk> ; the Greek press , previously eager * to <unk> off <unk> 's line , has turned on Mr. <unk> with a <unk> <unk> . 
Yet the possibility of another <unk> government is all too real . 
If Mr. <unk> becomes the major opposition leader , he could <unk> a <unk> coalition . 
Also , he could force new elections early next year by * <unk> the procedures for the election of the president of the republic in March . 
New <unk> has once again <unk> <unk> the opponent and linked its own prospects to negative reaction against <unk> , * <unk> * to tend to either program <unk> or the <unk> of internal <unk> . 
As for Mr. <unk> ? 
He 's not exactly sitting pretty at this stage . 
But since he is undoubtedly one of the most <unk> bull <unk> who *T* ever <unk> <unk> , it <unk> seems far <unk> * to view him as <unk> , but certainly not yet eliminated . 
Mr. <unk> , a regional correspondent for National Review , has lived in <unk> since 1981 .

A federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled that shareholders <unk> n't hold corporate officials liable for false sales projections on new products if the news media <unk> revealed substantial information about the product 's <unk> . 
The ruling stems from a 1984 suit filed * by shareholders of Apple Computer Inc. , claiming that company officials <unk> investors about the expected success of the <unk> computer , introduced * in 1983 . 
Lawyers specializing in shareholder suits said 0 they are concerned that use of the `` press defense '' by corporations may become popular as a result of the ruling . 
According to the suit , Apple officials created public excitement by * <unk> <unk> as an office computer that *T* would <unk> the workplace and be extremely successful in its first year . 
The plaintiffs also alleged that prior to the <unk> , the company circulated internal <unk> indicating problems with <unk> . 
The suit claimed 0 Apple 's stock climbed to a high of $ <unk> *U* a share on the basis of the company 's optimistic forecasts . 
But when the company revealed <unk> 's poor sales late in 1983 *T* , the stock plummeted to a low of $ <unk> *U* a share , according to the suit . 
The shareholders claimed more than $ 150 million *U* in losses . 
In 1987 , the San Francisco district court dismissed the case largely because newspaper reports had sufficiently <unk> the company 's statements by * <unk> consumers to <unk> 's problems . 
Late last month , the appeals court agreed that most of the case should be dismissed * . 
However , it gave the shareholders the right * to pursue a small portion of their claim that *T* <unk> to <unk> 's disk drive , known * as <unk> . 
The court ruled that the news media did n't reveal <unk> 's problems at the time . 
Lawyers are worried about the ruling 's <unk> in other shareholder suits but pointed out that the court stressed that the ruling should be regarded * as very specific to the Apple case . 
`` The court was careful * to say that the adverse information appeared in the very same articles <unk> and received the same attention <unk> as the company 's statements , '' said *T* Patrick <unk> , a Los Angeles lawyer at the firm of <unk> & <unk> , which *T* was n't involved * in the case .

For third quarter last year , <unk> reported a $ 1 million *U* loss from continuing operations and a $ 200,000 *U* loss from discontinued operations , for a net loss of $ 1.2 million *U* . 
Revenue for the latest third quarter was about $ <unk> million *U* , up 10 % from $ <unk> million *U* last year , he said *T* . 
Mr. Simmons said 0 the results signal a turnaround for the maker of wire and wire products , which *T* has <unk> * to remain competitive in the face of <unk> , imported steel . 
A new $ 46 million *U* steel <unk> <unk> , which *T* got off to a <unk> start in early 1988 , now is running efficiently and a new management team is more heavily marketing <unk> 's products , Mr. Simmons said 0 *T* . 
As a result , the company hopes * to report net income for the year of about $ 11.6 million *U* , or about $ <unk> *U* to $ <unk> *U* a share , compared with a net loss of $ <unk> million *U* last year , after a loss from discontinued operations of $ <unk> million *U* . 
Revenue for 1989 is expected * to be about $ 300 million *U* , up about 21 % from $ <unk> million *U* in 1988 . 
For the nine months ended Sept. 30 , <unk> expects * to report net income of $ 9.3 *U* <unk> , or about $ <unk> *U* a share , after an extraordinary gain from $ 3.2 million *U* in tax benefits . 
Last year , the company had a net loss of $ 6.5 million *U* , including a $ 6.1 million *U* loss from continuing operations and a $ 400,000 *U* loss from discontinued operations . 
Revenue for the nine months is expected * to be about $ <unk> million *U* , up about 21 % from $ <unk> million *U* last year . 
Mr. Simmons said 0 <unk> 's new mill is expected * to produce about <unk> tons of steel <unk> this year , up from <unk> tons in 1988 . 
Production at the mill has exceeded the ability <unk> of <unk> 's casting operation * to supply it , he said 0 *T* , which *T* will force <unk> * to purchase <unk> , or <unk> steel bars , from outside the company during the fourth quarter and next year . 
<unk> will have * to consider * expanding its casting operation , at an estimated cost of $ 8 million to $ 10 million *U* , within the next 18 to 24 months , Mr. Simmons said 0 *T* . 
Under Robert W. Singer , who *T* was named * president and chief operating officer last year , <unk> has expanded its sales force to about 20 people from about 15 and hopes * * to expand its sales from the middle portion of the country toward the East and West <unk> . 
`` Prior to a year ago , <unk> was an <unk> . 
Now I think 0 we have a group of marketing people who *T* are out * selling to retailers and <unk> , '' Mr. Simmons said *T* . 
Still , he said 0 *T* , the <unk> company plans * to continue its <unk> strategy for its <unk> brand of <unk> wire <unk> and other products . 
The company claims a 40 % share of the U.S. field <unk> business , a 35 % share of <unk> <unk> sales and a 30 % share of <unk> wire sales . 
<unk> Inc. said 0 a temporary <unk> of operations at its <unk> <unk> <unk> facility in <unk> , La. , will result in slight earnings improvement to both the company and its <unk> <unk> Partners Limited Partnership unit . 
The company did n't elaborate . 
The diversified energy and minerals concern said that a depressed uranium market is responsible for the temporary <unk> of the plant , but that the plant can be <unk> * quickly when the market <unk> *T* . 
More than 400,000 pounds of uranium a year have been produced * at the facility during the past seven years . 
A second <unk> plant at <unk> Sam , La. , that *T* produces more than 700,000 pounds of uranium annually , will continue * to operate . 
<unk> said 0 the shutdown <unk> n't affect sales volumes under long-term sales contracts of its <unk> <unk> <unk> Co. unit , but will reduce the amount of product sold * on the spot market . 
<unk> <unk> Partners , as owner of the <unk> technology , receives royalty payments . 
Business Week subscribers may hear this week 's issue talking back to them . 
A <unk> ad from Texas Instruments Inc. , running in approximately <unk> issues of the Oct. 20 `` Corporate <unk> '' issue of the McGraw-Hill Inc. publication , contains a speech <unk> <unk> * between two of the pages . 
<unk> who *T* pull off a piece of tape and press a switch will hear a tiny -- but <unk> <unk> -- voice announce , `` I am the talking chip , '' as it launches into a <unk> <unk> on its own attributes . 
The talking chip is n't cheap -- the <unk> cost to Texas Instruments is about $ 4 *U* , and that 's without * adding in Business Week 's charge -- but Texas Instruments believes 0 it is a first . 
<unk> efforts have included musical ads , featuring simple <unk> chips that *T* play a tune , but the voice <unk> in this effort is much more sophisticated , with none of the <unk> <unk> that one <unk> *T* , for example , when * calling telephone <unk> services *T* . 
And for those who *T* miss the message the first time around , not * to worry : Three tiny batteries provide enough juice for as many as 650 <unk> . 
Lomas Financial Corp. , Dallas , said 0 it will ask a U.S. bankruptcy court * to allow it * to hire Lazard Freres & Co. * to help it sell its leasing unit . 
Lomas , assisted * by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets , has been trying * to sell its Equitable Lomas Leasing Co. for several months , apparently without success . 
The real estate and mortgage banking concern had hoped * to use proceeds from the sale * to reduce its debt . 
* Without cash from asset sales and unable * to reach a new <unk> agreement , Lomas defaulted on $ 145 million *U* in notes that *T* became due Sept. 1 . 
It filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code Sept. 24 * to give it additional time 0 * to work on a plan * to restructure its $ <unk> billion *U* in senior debt *T* . 
Lomas said 0 Merrill Lynch , which *T* owns bonds and equity in Lomas , could n't continue as Lomas 's investment banker because it is also a creditor . 
It said 0 it chose Lazard in part because of Lazard 's offices in Europe and Japan , where investors might be interested in a U.S. leasing company *T* . 
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce said 0 it will increase its loan-loss provisions * to cover all its loans to lesser developed countries , except Mexico , * resulting in an after-tax charge to 1989 earnings of 300 million Canadian dollars -LRB- <unk> <unk> million *U* -RRB- . 
Don <unk> , senior vice president and chief accountant , said 0 the bank 's strong earnings enable it to be the first major Canadian bank 0 *T* to set aside provisions covering all its <unk> <unk> billion *U* in <unk> <unk> debt . 
`` It <unk> the continuing uncertainty with respect to the ultimate value of the loans , '' he said *T* . 
The bank said 0 about <unk> <unk> million *U* will be added * to its existing <unk> and general loss provisions in its fourth quarter , ending Oct. 31 . 
Mr. <unk> said 0 the <unk> 300 million *U* charge to earnings would amount to about <unk> <unk> *U* a share . 
The bank 's net income for the nine months ended July 31 was <unk> <unk> million *U* , or <unk> <unk> *U* a share . 
Mr. <unk> said 0 the bank will restructure its <unk> <unk> million *U* of Mexican debt , of which <unk> <unk> million *U* is in Mexican notes secured * by U.S. government bonds . 
The bank has a 45 % reserve against the remaining <unk> <unk> million *U* of Mexican debt and expects * to swap that for other Mexican notes supported * by U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds . 
Mr. <unk> said 0 the bank 's experience with <unk> debt has been `` painful '' and this latest move represents the final phase of a program begun * seven years ago * to reduce its exposure through <unk> , debt sales and debt swaps . 
He said 0 the bank will no longer participate in <unk> <unk> lending , but will support trade financing and other transactions that *T* meet the bank 's standards . 
The <unk> among takeover stocks Friday does n't mean the end of <unk> but simply marks the start of a less ambitious game , Wall Street 's <unk> deal makers say *T* . 
<unk> from now on are more likely * to be <unk> companies , rather than raiders or <unk> <unk> . 
And they will be launching <unk> and perhaps fewer deals , now that it <unk> 's tougher * to finance them . 
This is an <unk> sign for a stock market that *T* lately has been fueled * by takeover speculation and bidding wars for companies that *T* put themselves up for sale . 
<unk> the 1980s merger boom seems * to be <unk> *T* , shock waves <unk> through the stock market . 
`` The market is <unk> , not cheap , '' says *T* Alan <unk> of the New York <unk> firm <unk> <unk> . 
He recently began * increasing his cash position to 45 % of his portfolio . 
`` I look at where deals can get done , '' he says *T* , `` and they 're not getting done '' at current prices . 
<unk> are growing increasingly nervous about <unk> takeovers , investment bankers say 0 *T* . 
`` You had a week of a deteriorating junk-bond market that *T* ran <unk> into the news on Friday about what *T* appeared * to be happening to the bank debt market , '' says *T* Steven <unk> , a partner and merger specialist with Lazard Freres & <unk> . 
Trading <unk> up Friday in the market for high-yield junk bonds , often used * * to finance takeovers . 
It was the latest in a series of setbacks for the junk bond market , where prices began * weakening last month after Campeau hit a cash crunch *T* . 
And banks appear * to be taking an increasingly skeptical view of requests for high-risk takeover loans . 
The group trying * to buy UAL announced Friday that it could n't arrange the $ 7.2 billion *U* in bank loans 0 it needs *T* * to buy the parent of United Airlines for $ 300 *U* a share . 
<unk> traders today will be scrambling * to learn of any UAL developments , and other takeover stocks are likely * to trade in sympathy . 
Investment bankers representing the buy-out group and UAL 's board spent a <unk> weekend * trying * to <unk> out new terms that *T* would be more acceptable to the banks . 
After UAL , the stock viewed * as most vulnerable is American Airlines ' parent AMR , the target of a $ <unk> *U* takeover proposal from New York real estate developer Donald Trump . 
* Trading in AMR shares was suspended * shortly after 3 p.m. EDT Friday and did n't resume . 
Before the halt , AMR last traded at 98 <unk> . 
Late Friday night , the London office of Jefferies & Co. , a Los Angeles securities firm , traded AMR shares at prices as low as 80 . 
Similarly , Delta Air Lines and USAir Group dropped 10.1 % and 8.5 % , respectively , on Friday and could weaken further . 
Over the <unk> , however , two developments in other deals indicated that <unk> banks and Wall Street firms still are willing * to commit billions of dollars * to finance takeover bids launched * by major companies . 
<unk> S.A. , a major Mexican glass maker , said yesterday that it agreed * to buy Anchor Glass <unk> in a tender offer for $ <unk> *U* a share , sweetened * from the original $ <unk> *U* offer 0 <unk> launched *T* two months ago . 
On Friday , Anchor shares fell 1 <unk> * to close at 18 <unk> . 
For the broader market , the greatest significance of the <unk> deal may be that it was put * together late Friday night -- after the market <unk> -- and involves a $ 155 million *U* temporary `` bridge '' loan from Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Securities and a $ <unk> million *U* loan from Security Pacific National Bank . 
Moreover , * to complete the entire Anchor Glass purchase and refinance existing debt , Donaldson said 0 it is `` highly confident '' that it will be able * to sell $ 400 million *U* of junk bonds for <unk> , despite the current <unk> in the junk bond market . 
Donaldson 's statement is n't merely an idle <unk> , because those bonds will have * to be sold * before Donaldson 's bridge loan can be paid * back . 
Security Pacific , meanwhile , said 0 it expects * to arrange $ <unk> million *U* in bank loans for <unk> . 
In another takeover battle , a spokesman for McCaw Cellular Communications said yesterday that McCaw has been advised * by three commercial banks that they remain `` highly confident '' 0 they can arrange $ 4.5 billion *U* of bank loans for McCaw 's tender offer for about 45 % of LIN Broadcasting , `` <unk> recent events . '' 
McCaw is offering $ 125 *U* a share for 22 million LIN shares , * thereby challenging LIN 's proposal * to spin off its television properties , pay shareholders a $ <unk> *U* special dividend and combine its <unk> operations with BellSouth 's cellular business . 
On Friday , LIN shares were among the few takeover issues that *T* did n't fall much , * dropping 5 <unk> , or 4.9 % , * to close at 107 <unk> . 
Traders and investment bankers said 0 LIN shares were n't hurt * much because BellSouth is viewed * as a <unk> corporate buyer unlikely * to be affected * by <unk> among bankers or bond buyers . 
Investment bankers interviewed * over the weekend see a silver lining for the merger business in the stock-market drop . 
<unk> bidders for companies `` were saying that things were beginning * to look expensive , '' says 0 *T* Mr. <unk> of Lazard . 
`` Nothing makes things look cheaper than a <unk> drop in the Dow , '' Mr. <unk> says *T* . 
`` Just as there are people waiting * to become bargain <unk> in the stock market , there are people waiting * to become bargain <unk> in the deal market . '' 
Investment bankers expect most of those bargain <unk> to be <unk> corporations . 
`` In the past , corporate buyers were often discouraged * from * making bids because of competition from LBO firms , which *T* were often prepared * to <unk> '' the corporations , says 0 *T* J. <unk> Hill , head of mergers and acquisitions at Shearson Lehman Hutton . 
Now , `` corporate buyers should be willing * to <unk> the acquisition market because the competition from <unk> buyers has been reduced * . '' 
Many takeover stocks plunged Friday , as speculators retained their confidence in corporate buyers but fled from the <unk> <unk> stocks , the targets of rumored deals . 
Columbia Pictures Entertainment , which *T* has agreed to a friendly $ <unk> *U* bid from Sony of Japan , fell only <unk> * to close at 26 <unk> . 
But several stocks long rumored * to be <unk> for a takeover or restructuring fell 10 % or more . 
They include USX , down 11.7 % ; Upjohn , down <unk> % ; Campbell <unk> , down 11 % ; Paramount Communications , off 10.3 % ; Woolworth , down 10.2 % ; Delta Air Lines , down 10.1 % , and MCA , down 9.7 % . 
The market -- and investment bankers -- are even less <unk> about companies that *T* have had at least one bid , merger agreement or restructuring plan fall through already . 
Given the weakness in both the junk bond market and the stock market , traders fear that these transactions may be revised * yet again . 
<unk> include <unk> , whose agreement * to be acquired * for $ 25 *U* a share by <unk> *T* collapsed last month . 
<unk> shares fell nearly 20 % on Friday * to close at 12 <unk> . 
Ramada , which *T* first delayed <unk> and then <unk> <unk> a $ 400 million *U* junk bond sale that *T* was designed * to help * finance a restructuring , fell <unk> % * to close at 9 <unk> . 
Ramada has said 0 it hopes * to propose a new restructuring plan but has n't indicated when it will do so . 
Shares of American Medical International , which *T* agreed last week * to accept a lower price from a buy-out group that *T* includes First Boston Corp. and the Pritzker family of Chicago , fell 15.8 % on Friday * to close at 20 . 
The buy-out group is offering $ <unk> *U* a share for 63 million American Medical shares , down from its offer in July of $ 28 *U* a share for <unk> million shares . 
But investment bankers say 0 the market may have <unk> some <unk> stocks . 
Hilton Hotels , for example , was among the <unk> issues , * falling <unk> % * to close at 85 , down 21 <unk> on Friday . 
Hilton currently is soliciting bids for a sale of part or all of its hotel and casino businesses . 
People familiar with Hilton said over the weekend that the depth of the sell-off in Hilton shares was <unk> because none of the likely buyers would be dependent on junk-bond financing . 
However , they conceded that some potential bidders would rely on bank loans and would * be hurt if the troubles of the UAL buy-out group <unk> a general <unk> <unk> among banks * to provide credit for <unk> takeovers . 
Hilton officials said 0 they were n't worried about the drop in the company 's stock . 
William <unk> , Hilton 's general counsel , said 0 plans * to consider a sale of the company or some of its assets are `` on track '' for what *T* has been described * previously as `` a slow and <unk> process . '' 
`` I <unk> n't believe that any potential buyer for Hilton would be affected * by one day 's trading , '' Mr. <unk> said *T* . 
But the stock market as a whole , * bolstered as it is *?* by takeover speculation , remains vulnerable to any further <unk> by takeover <unk> , both in the <unk> market and among commercial banks . 
For <unk> suitors , `` the takeover game has been over for some time , '' says 0 *T* New York money manager Neil <unk> of <unk> Capital , who *T* has been keeping 85 % of his portfolio in cash . 
`` The market is just <unk> up to that point . '' 
<unk> <unk> in Los Angeles contributed to this column . 
Of all the one-time expenses incurred * by a corporation or professional firm , few *T* are larger or longer term than the purchase of real estate or the signing of a commercial lease . 
* To take full advantage of the financial opportunities in this commitment , however , the corporation or professional firm must do more than negotiate the best purchase price or lease terms . 
It must also evaluate the real-estate market in the chosen location from a new perspective . 
Specifically , it must understand how real-estate markets <unk> to shifts in regional economies *T* and then take advantage of these opportunities . 
When a regional economy <unk> cold *T* , the local real-estate market gets <unk> . 
In other words , real-estate market indicators , such as building permits and leasing activity , <unk> much further than a local economy in recession . 
This was seen * in the late 1960s in Los Angeles and the mid-1970s in New York . 
But the reverse is also true : When a region 's economy <unk> from a slowdown *T* , these real-estate indicators will rebound far faster than the improving economy . 
Why do local real-estate markets <unk> to regional economic <unk> *T* ? 
Because real-estate purchases and leases are such major long-term commitments that most companies and individuals make these decisions only when * confident of future economic stability and growth *T* . 
Metropolitan Detroit was written * off economically during the early 1980s , as the domestic auto industry suffered a serious sales depression and adjustment . 
<unk> employment dropped by 13 % from its 1979 peak and retail sales were down 14 % . 
However , the real-estate market was hurt * even more . 
For example , residential building permits in the <unk> year of 1982 were off 76 % from the 1979 peak level . 
Once metropolitan Detroit 's economy rallied in the <unk> , real estate rebounded . 
Building permits , for example , soared a <unk> 400 % between 1982 and the peak year of 1986 . 
Where , <unk> corporations and professional firms are now asking , are *T* today 's opportunities ? 
* Look no further than metropolitan Houston and Denver , two of the most depressed , <unk> and potentially undervalued real-estate markets in the nation . 
Of course , some observers have touted Houston and Denver for the past five years as a <unk> play . 
But now appears * to be the time 0 * to act *T* . 
Metropolitan Houston 's economy did drop and then <unk> in the years after its 1982 peak . 
In the <unk> , employment was down as much as 5 % from the 1982 peak and retail sales were off 13 % . 
The real-estate market suffered even more severe setbacks . 
Office construction dropped 97 % . 
The vacancy rate soared more than 20 % in nearly every product category , and more than 30 % of office space was vacant . 
To some observers , the empty office buildings of Houston 's `` <unk> <unk> '' were <unk> of a very troubled economy . 
As usual , the real-estate market had <unk> . 
Actually , the region 's economy retained a firm foundation . 
Metropolitan Houston 's population has held * steady over the past six years . 
And personal income , after * slumping in the <unk> , has returned to its 1982 level in real dollar terms . 
Today , metropolitan Houston 's real-estate market is poised for a significant turnaround . 
More than <unk> jobs were added * in <unk> Houston last year , primarily in biotechnology , petrochemical processing , and the computer industry . 
This growth puts Houston in the top five <unk> areas in the nation last year . 
And forecasts project a 2.5 % to 3 % *U* growth rate in jobs over the next few years -- nearly twice the national average . 
Denver is another metropolitan area where the commercial real-estate market has <unk> to the region 's economic trends *T* , although Denver has not experienced as severe an economic downturn as Houston . 
By some measures , metropolitan Denver 's economy has actually improved in the past four years . 
Its population has continued * to increase since 1983 , the peak year of the economic cycle . 
Employment is now 4 % higher than in 1983 . 
<unk> income in real dollars actually increased 15 % between 1983 and 1987 -LRB- the most recent year available -RRB- . 
The rates of increase , however , are less than the rapid growth of the boom years , and this has resulted in a loss of confidence in the economy . 
In a <unk> <unk> , therefore , the region 's real-estate market all but collapsed in recent years . 
Housing building permits are down more than 75 % from their 1983 <unk> . 
Although no one can predict when metropolitan Denver 's real-estate market will rebound *T* , major public works projects costing several billion dollars <unk> are under way or planned * -- such as a new convention center , a major <unk> <unk> the metropolitan area , and a new regional airport . 
When Denver 's regional economy begins * to grow faster *T* -- such a recovery could occur as early as next year -- business and consumer confidence will return , and the resulting explosion of real-estate activity will <unk> the general economic rebound . 
What real-estate strategy should one follow *T* in a metropolitan area whose economic health *T* is not as easy 0 * to determine *T* as Houston 's or Denver 's ? 
Generally , <unk> in commercial real estate is dropping from its <unk> peak , even in such economically healthy metropolitan areas as Washington , New York and Los Angeles . 
<unk> rates in the 15 % to 19 % *U* range today may easily rise to the low to <unk> % range in a couple of years . 
Under these conditions , even a <unk> out of economic growth -- `` * catching cold '' -- in the healthy metropolitan areas will create significant opportunities for corporations and professional service firms looking for bargains as the <unk> industry <unk> <unk> . 
Those looking for real-estate bargains in <unk> metropolitan areas should lock in leases or buy now ; those looking in healthy metropolitan areas should take a short-term -LRB- three-year -RRB- lease and wait for the bargains ahead . 
Mr. <unk> is managing partner of a real-estate advisory firm based * in Beverly Hills , <unk> . 
<unk> Industrial Corp. said 0 it expects its third-quarter net earnings to be between two cents and four cents *U* a share , compared with 61 cents a share a year ago . 
Analysts had been <unk> that the company 's earnings would be between 25 cents and 30 cents *U* a share . 
The year-earlier third-quarter earnings amounted to $ 4.1 million *U* . 
The company said 0 a drop in activity in the <unk> industry reduced sales volume at its two <unk> operations . 
Also , the company said 0 its commercial products operation failed * to meet forecasts . 
<unk> , a maker of <unk> truck and commercial <unk> equipment , said 0 it expects its fourth-quarter earnings to be more closely in line with usual levels , which *T* are between 30 cents and 50 cents *U* a share . 
Common <unk> asked both the Senate Ethics Committee and the Justice Department * to investigate $ 1 million *U* in political gifts by Arizona businessman Charles <unk> to five U.S. senators who *T* <unk> with <unk> regulators for him . 
Mr. <unk> is currently the subject of a $ 1.1 billion *U* federal <unk> lawsuit accusing him of * <unk> off assets of a California thrift 0 he controlled *T* , Lincoln Savings & Loan Association , and driving it into <unk> . 
Fred <unk> -- president of Common <unk> , the <unk> citizens lobby -- said 0 Mr. <unk> already has conceded * attempting * to buy influence with the lawmakers -- Democratic <unk> Dennis <unk> of Arizona , Alan <unk> of California , John Glenn of Ohio and Donald <unk> of Michigan ; and GOP Sen. John <unk> of Arizona . 
Mr. <unk> based this on a statement by Mr. <unk> that *T* was quoted * in a Wall Street Journal story in April : `` One question <unk> had * to do with whether my financial support in any way influenced several political figures to take up my cause . 
I want * to say in the most <unk> way 0 I can *?* *T* : 0 I certainly hope so . '' 
In a highly unusual meeting in Sen. <unk> 's office in April 1987 , the five senators asked federal regulators * to ease up on Lincoln . 
According to notes taken * by one of the participants at the meeting , the regulators said 0 Lincoln was gambling <unk> with depositors ' federally insured money and was `` a <unk> time bomb . '' 
Mr. <unk> had complained that the regulators were being too <unk> . 
The notes show that Sen. <unk> called the Federal Home Loan Bank Board 's regulations `` grossly unfair , '' and that Sen. Glenn insisted that Mr. <unk> 's thrift was `` viable and profitable . '' 
For the next two years , the Bank Board , which at the time *T* was the agency responsible for * <unk> thrifts , failed * to act -- even after federal auditors warned in May 1987 that Mr. <unk> had caused Lincoln to become insolvent . 
Lincoln 's parent company , American Continental Corp. , entered bankruptcy-law proceedings this April 13 , and regulators seized the thrift the next day . 
The newly formed <unk> Trust Corp. , successor to the Bank Board , filed suit against Mr. <unk> and several others on Sept. 15 . 
Mr. <unk> has filed his own suit , * alleging that his property was taken * illegally . 
The cost to taxpayers of Lincoln 's collapse has been estimated * at as much as $ 2.5 billion *U* . 
Details of the affair have become public gradually over the past two years , mostly as a result of reporting by several newspapers . 
In the midst of his 1988 re-election campaign , Sen. <unk> , chairman of the Senate Banking Committee , returned $ <unk> *U* in contributions after a Detroit newspaper said that Mr. <unk> had gathered the money for him about two weeks before the meeting with regulators . 
Sen. <unk> , after months of * <unk> off intense press criticism , returned $ <unk> *U* only last month , shortly after the government formally accused Mr. <unk> of * <unk> Lincoln . 
In addition , Sen. <unk> last week disclosed that he <unk> had paid $ <unk> *U* to American Continental as <unk> for trips 0 he and his family took *T* aboard the corporate jet to Mr. <unk> 's vacation home at <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , from 1984 through 1986 . 
Sen. <unk> said 0 he had meant * to pay for the trips at the time but that the matter `` fell between the <unk> . '' 
Mr. <unk> , his family members and associates also donated $ <unk> *U* to Sen. <unk> 's congressional campaigns over the years , according to press accounts . 
But Sen. <unk> says 0 Mr. <unk> broke off their <unk> abruptly in 1987 , because the senator refused * to press the thrift executive 's case as vigorously as Mr. <unk> wanted *?* . 
`` He became very angry at that , left my office and told a number of people that I was a <unk> , '' Sen. <unk> recalls *T* . 
In July , California newspapers disclosed that Mr. <unk> gave $ <unk> *U* in corporate funds to three tax-exempt <unk> registration organizations in 1987 and 1988 at the <unk> of Sen. <unk> , who *T* conceded that * soliciting the money was `` a pretty stupid thing 0 * to do *T* politically . '' 
In addition , Sen. <unk> received $ <unk> *U* in campaign donations through Mr. <unk> , and the California Democratic party received $ <unk> *U* in corporate donations for a 1986 <unk> drive that *T* benefited the senator 's re-election campaign that year . 
Also in July , Ohio newspapers disclosed $ 200,000 *U* in corporate donations by Mr. <unk> to the National Council on Public Policy , a political committee controlled * by Sen. Glenn . 
That was in addition to $ <unk> *U* in direct campaign donations arranged * by Mr. <unk> to the Ohio senator . 
Mr. <unk> said 0 the Senate Ethics Committee should hire a special outside counsel * to conduct an investigation , as * was done in the case of former House Speaker James Wright . 
Wilson <unk> , staff director of the ethics panel , would n't comment . 
Sen. <unk> said 0 he would cooperate with any inquiry , but that his conduct had been `` entirely proper . '' 
Sen. <unk> said 0 he had been `` deeply concerned <unk> '' at the time of the meeting that it might seem * to be improper , but decided 0 it was `` entirely appropriate '' for him to seek fair treatment for a <unk> . 
Sen. Glenn said 0 he had already made a complete disclosure of his role in the affair and `` I am completely satisfied * to let this matter rest in the hands of the Senate Ethics Committee . '' 
Sen. <unk> said , `` When all is said and done *T* , I expect * to be fully <unk> * . '' 
Sen. <unk> , who *T* had already <unk> his help to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in any investigation of Mr. <unk> , portrayed his role in 1987 as * <unk> regulators to act . 
`` Why did n't the Bank Board act sooner *T* ? '' he said *T* . 
`` That is what Common <unk> should ask 0 *T* be investigated * .

<unk> estimated the value of the pact at more than $ 40 million *U* .

It said 0 the 1,000 rail cars are in addition to the <unk> coal rail cars <unk> being produced for Norfolk Southern , a Norfolk , Va.-based railroad concern .

Today , with about 75 % of the companies ' products being made * in China , the chairman of the Hong Kong Toys Council , Dennis <unk> , has suggested a new <unk> label : `` <unk> * in China by Hong Kong Companies . '' 
The toy makers were pushed * across the border by rising labor and land costs in the British colony . 
But in the wake of the <unk> in Beijing on June 4 , the Hong Kong toy industry is worrying about its strong dependence on China . 
Although the manufacturers stress that production has n't been affected * by China 's political turmoil , they are looking for additional sites . 
The toy makers , and their foreign buyers , cite uncertainty about China 's economic and political policies . 
`` Nobody wants * to have all his eggs in one basket , '' says *T* David <unk> , chairman and chief executive officer of International <unk> Group <unk> . 
Indeed , <unk> and other leading Hong Kong toy makers were setting up factories in Southeast Asia , especially in Thailand , long before the <unk> . 
Their steps were partly prompted * by concern over a deterioration of business conditions in southern China . 
By * <unk> supply sources , the toy makers do n't intend * to withdraw from China , manufacturers and foreign buyers say 0 *T* . 
It <unk> would n't be easy * to <unk> quickly the manufacturing capacity built up in southern China during the past decade . 
A supply of cheap labor and the access to Hong Kong 's port , airport , banks and support industries , such as printing companies , have made China 's <unk> province a premier manufacturing site . 
`` South China is the most competitive source of toys in the world , '' says *T* Henry <unk> , executive director of <unk> <unk> Toys Consolidated <unk> . 
Hong Kong trade figures <unk> the toy makers ' reliance on factories across the border . 
In 1988 , exports of <unk> produced toys and games fell 19 % from 1987 , to <unk> <unk> billion *U* -LRB- <unk> <unk> billion *U* -RRB- . 
But <unk> , mainly from China , jumped 75 % , to <unk> <unk> billion *U* . 
In 1989 's first seven months , domestic exports fell 29 % , to <unk> <unk> billion *U* , while <unk> rose 56 % , to <unk> <unk> billion *U* . 
Manufacturers say 0 there is no immediate substitute for southern China , where an estimated <unk> people are employed * by the toy industry *T* . 
`` For the next few years , * like it or not , China is going * to be the main supplier , '' says *T* <unk> Young , vice president of <unk> Enterprises Ltd. , one of the first big Hong Kong toy makers 0 *T* to move across the border . 
In the meantime , as manufacturers and buyers seek new sites , they are focusing mainly on Southeast Asia . 
Several big companies have established manufacturing joint ventures in Thailand , including <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> Industrial Co. , the toy manufacturer headed * by Mr. <unk> . 
Malaysia , the Philippines and Indonesia also are being studied * . 
With the European Community set * to remove its internal trade barriers in 1992 , several Hong Kong companies are beginning * to consider Spain , Portugal and Greece as possible manufacturing sites . 
<unk> about China came just as Hong Kong 's toy industry was recovering from a 1987 sales slump and bankruptcy filings by two major U.S. companies , <unk> of <unk> Inc. and Coleco Industries <unk> . 
Hong Kong manufacturers say 0 large debt <unk> and other financial problems resulting from the 1987 difficulties <unk> the local industry , * causing it to tighten credit policies and financial management . 
The industry <unk> last year and this year as a period of recovery that *T* will lead to improved results . 
Still , they long for a `` <unk> '' toy to <unk> retail sales in the U.S. , Hong Kong 's biggest market for toys and games . 
The closest thing 0 the colony 's companies have *T* to a U.S. <unk> this year is the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> series of action figures manufactured * by <unk> Holdings <unk> . 
* <unk> in <unk> , the <unk> plastic <unk> are based * on an American comic book and television series . 
Paul <unk> , managing director of <unk> , says 0 10 million <unk> <unk> have been sold * , * placing the <unk> <unk> among the 10 <unk> toys in the U.S. . 
Should sales continue * to be strong through the Christmas season , which *T* accounts for about 60 % of U.S. retail toy sales , Mr. <unk> said 0 the <unk> <unk> could make 1989 a record sales year for <unk> . 
Other Hong Kong manufacturers expect their results to improve only slightly this year from 1988 . 
Besides the lack of a <unk> product , they cite the continued dominance of the U.S. market by <unk> Entertainment System , an expensive video game made * by <unk> Co. of Japan . 
<unk> buyers have little money left * to spend on other products . 
Many of the toy makers ' problems started well before June 4 as a result of <unk> infrastructure and Beijing 's austerity programs launched * late last year . 
<unk> makers complain that electricity in <unk> has been provided * only three days a week in recent months , down from five days a week , as the province 's rapid <unk> has <unk> its generating capacity . 
Manufacturers are upgrading <unk> power plants . 
Bank credit for China investments all but <unk> up following June 4 . 
Also , concern exists that the <unk> Beijing leadership will tighten its control of <unk> , which *T* has been the main laboratory for the <unk> policy and economic reforms . 
But , toy manufacturers and other <unk> say 0 Beijing will be restrained * from * tightening controls on <unk> southern China . 
They say 0 China 's trade deficit is widening and the country is too short <unk> of foreign exchange for it to <unk> production in <unk> . 
`` The Chinese leaders have * to decide whether they want control or whether the want exports , '' says *T* Mr. <unk> of <unk> . 
The Bush administration , * urging the Supreme Court * to give states more <unk> * to restrict <unk> , said 0 <unk> have n't any right to abortion without the consent of their parents . 
<unk> General Kenneth <unk> argued that the 1973 Supreme Court decision , <unk> vs. <unk> , <unk> a constitutional right to abortion , was <unk> . 
He also argued that the high court was wrong in 1976 * to rule that <unk> have a right to abortion that *T* <unk> n't be absolutely <unk> * by their parents . 
The administration 's position was outlined * in a <unk> brief filed * in one of three abortion cases 0 the Supreme Court will hear *T* argued and will decide *T* this term . 
The administration filed the brief in an appeal involving a Minnesota law that *T* requires that both parents of a minor be notified * before she may have an abortion . 
The administration urged the justices * to adopt a legal standard suggested * by Chief Justice William <unk> last July when the high court upheld Missouri 's abortion restrictions *T* . 
Under that standard , which *T* <unk> the votes of only three of the nine justices , a state restriction of abortion is constitutional if the state has a `` reasonable '' <unk> for * adopting it . 
That is a much easier standard 0 for a state to satisfy *T* than the Supreme Court 's test since 1973 , which *T* requires a state to have a `` compelling '' reason for * restricting abortion . 
On the provisions of the Minnesota law , the Bush administration said that * requiring that both parents be notified * is a reasonable regulation , and that there is no need * to have an alternative that *T* allows <unk> to go to court for a judge 's permission instead . 
The case , <unk> vs. Minnesota , will be argued * Nov. 29 . 
Aluminum Co. of America , hit hard by the strength of the dollar overseas , said 0 net income for the third quarter dropped 3.2 % to $ <unk> million *U* , or $ <unk> *U* a share . 
The nation 's No. 1 aluminum maker earned $ <unk> million *U* , or $ <unk> *U* a share , a year earlier . 
Revenue rose 11 % to $ <unk> billion *U* from $ <unk> billion *U* . 
Analysts , who *T* were expecting Alcoa to post around $ <unk> to $ 3 *U* a share , were surprised at the lackluster third-quarter results . 
`` It 's disappointing , '' said *T* William <unk> , an analyst with Smith Barney , Harris Upham & <unk> . 
Much of the earnings decline was led * by <unk> rate adjustments , which *T* affected the bottom line by $ <unk> million *U* , or 17 cents a share , compared with $ 3.6 million *U* , or four cents a share , the previous year . 
Lower prices for aluminum <unk> and certain <unk> products and a shift in the product mix also contributed to lower earnings , the company said 0 *T* . 
`` In addition , costs were higher partly due to scheduled plant <unk> for modernization work , '' the company said *T* . 
Excluding the higher tax rate , which *T* rose two percentage points to 38 % , and the negative exchange rate adjustment , the company would have met analysts ' expectations , said *T* R. Wayne <unk> , an analyst with Goldman , Sachs & <unk> . 
* Noting that the third quarter is usually the aluminum industry 's <unk> , Mr. <unk> added , `` the third quarter is never a <unk> up period for them anyway . '' 
Nevertheless , the company said 0 shipments were up slightly to <unk> metric tons from <unk> , * <unk> the impact of the unexpected earning decline . 
The results were announced * after the stock market closed . 
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday , Alcoa closed at $ 72 *U* a share , down $ <unk> *U* , in a sharply lower market . 
For 20 years , federal rules have barred the three major television networks from * sharing in one of the most lucrative and fastest-growing parts of the television business . 
And for six years , NBC , ABC and CBS have negotiated with Hollywood studios in a <unk> attempt * to change that . 
But with foreign companies <unk> up U.S. movie studios , the networks are pressing their fight harder than ever . 
They hope 0 the foreign deals will divide the Hollywood opposition and <unk> Congress to push for * ending federal rules that *T* prohibit the networks from * <unk> a piece of <unk> sales and owning part of the shows 0 they put *T* on the air . 
Even network executives , however , admit privately that victory -- either in Congress or in talks with the studios -- is highly doubtful any time soon . 
And so the networks also are pushing for new ways 0 * to <unk> the `` <unk> '' provisions , known * formally as the Financial Interest and <unk> <unk> *T* . 
That became clear last week with the disclosure that National Broadcasting Co. , backed * by the deep pockets of parent General Electric Co. , had tried * to help * fund Qintex Australia Ltd. 's <unk> $ 1.5 billion *U* bid for <unk> Communications <unk> . 
NBC 's interest may revive the deal , which <unk> killed *T* last week when the Australian concern had trouble * raising cash *T* . 
Even if that deal is n't revived * , NBC hopes * to find another . 
`` Our doors are open , '' an NBC spokesman says *T* . 
NBC may yet find a way 0 * to take a passive , minority interest in a <unk> without * violating the rules *T* . 
And any NBC effort could prompt CBS Inc. and ABC 's parent , Capital <unk> Inc. , to look for ways of * <unk> the <unk> regulations . 
But the networks ' push may only <unk> an increasingly bitter <unk> between them and Hollywood studios . 
Both sides are * to sit down next month for yet another meeting on how they might agree on * reducing <unk> restraints *T* . 
Few people <unk> to the talks expect the studios to <unk> . 
The networks still are `` <unk> in their authority '' over what shows *T* get on the air , charges <unk> <unk> Association President Jack <unk> , the most <unk> opponent of * <unk> the rules . 
<unk> are `` <unk> '' * to get shows in prime-time <unk> and keep them there long enough * to go into lucrative <unk> sales , he contends 0 *T* . 
And that 's why the rules , for the most part , must stay in place *T* , he says 0 *T* . 
<unk> executives in on the talks - including officials at Paramount Communications Inc. , <unk> Entertainment Inc. , Warner Communications Inc. and MCA Inc. -- declined * to be interviewed * . 
But Mr. <unk> , who *T* represents the studios , asserts : `` 0 The whole production industry , to a man , is on the side of * <unk> '' the rules . 
Such <unk> leave network officials all the more doubtful that the studios will <unk> . 
`` They do n't seem * to have an incentive * to negotiate , '' says *T* one network executive . 
`` And there 's no indication that Washington is prepared * to address the rules . 
That 's the problem , is n't it *?* ? '' 
Indeed it is *?* . 
Congress has said repeatedly 0 it wants no part of the mess , * urging the studios and the networks , which *T* license rights to air shows made * by the studios , * to work out their own compromise . 
But recent developments have made the networks -- and NBC President Robert Wright , in particular -- ever more <unk> that the networks must be <unk> * to survive . 
The latest <unk> : Sony Corp. 's plan * to acquire Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. for $ 3.4 billion *U* , and * to buy independent producer <unk> Peters Entertainment Co. for $ 200 million *U* . 
`` I wonder what Walter <unk> will think of the <unk> <unk> System <unk> <unk> News with Dan Rather broadcast * exclusively from Tokyo , '' wrote *T* <unk> <unk> , an NBC vice president , in a <unk> in last week 's issue of Broadcasting magazine . 
In his article , Mr. <unk> , who *T* was in Europe last week and unavailable , complained that the `` <unk> restraints '' in <unk> rules have `` contributed directly to the acquisition of the studios by <unk> enterprises . 
'' -LRB- He did n't mention that NBC , in the meantime , was hoping * to assist Australia 's Qintex in buying 
An NBC spokesman counters that Mr. <unk> 's <unk> was `` entirely consistent '' with NBC plans because the U.S. rules would limit NBC 's involvement in the Qintex deal so severely as * to be `` light years away from the type of <unk> deals available to Sony -- and everyone else except the three networks . '' 
The Big Three 's <unk> for deregulation began * <unk> in the summer when the former Time Inc. went ahead with plans * to acquire Warner *T* . 
Although Time already had a long-term contract * to buy movies from Warner , the merger will let Time 's largely <unk> <unk> channel , Home <unk> Office , own the Warner movies aired * on HBO -- a <unk> integration that *T* is effectively blocked * by <unk> regulations . 
NBC 's Mr. Wright led the way in * <unk> the networks ' inability * to match a <unk> combination . 
He spoke up again when the Sony bid for Columbia was announced * *T* . 
Since NBC 's interest in the Qintex bid for <unk> was disclosed * , Mr. Wright has n't been available for comment . 
With a Qintex deal , NBC would move into <unk> territory -- * possibly raising <unk> at the studios and in Washington . 
`` It 's never really been tested * , '' says *T* William <unk> III , who as a top CBS executive *T* spent years * lobbying * to have the rules lifted . 
He now runs Policy Communications in Washington , * consulting to media companies . 
<unk> rules do n't explicitly block a network from * buying a passive , small stake in a company that *T* profits from the <unk> syndication 0 networks <unk> n't enjoy *T* . 
<unk> , NBC might be able * to take , * say , a 5 % stake in a company such as <unk> . 
If the transaction raised objections , the studio 's syndication operations could be spun off into a separate firm in which the network does n't have a direct stake *T* . 
But such <unk> would still block the networks from * <unk> a big chunk of the <unk> of syndication . 
Under current rules , even when a network fares well with a <unk> series -- ABC , for example , made a killing in * broadcasting its popular <unk> `` <unk> '' -- *T* it is n't allowed * to share in the continuing proceeds when the <unk> are sold * to local stations *T* . 
Instead , ABC will have * to sell off the rights for a one-time fee . 
The networks admit that the chances of * getting the relief 0 they want *T* are slim -- for several years at the least . 
Six years ago they were <unk> close . 
The <unk> Federal Communications Commission had ruled in favor of * killing most of the rules . 
<unk> evidence , including a <unk> Institution study of some 800 series that the networks had aired *T* and had partly owned *T* in the 1960s , showed 0 the networks did n't <unk> <unk> control over the studios as * had been alleged * . 
But just eight days before the rules were * to die , former President Ronald Reagan , a one-time actor , intervened on behalf of Hollywood . 
The FCC effort collapsed . 
The networks and studios have <unk> ever since . 
Network officials involved * in the studio talks may hope 0 the foreign <unk> builds more support in Washington , but that seems unlikely . 
In Congress , the issue <unk> : It 's about money , not program quality , and Hollywood has lots of clout given its fund raising for senators and representatives overseeing the issue . 
A spokesman for Rep. Edward J. <unk> -LRB- <unk> -RRB- , who *T* heads a subcommittee that *T* oversees the FCC , says 0 Mr. <unk> feels `` 0 the world has been forever changed * by the <unk> deal . '' 
But he said 0 Mr. <unk> hopes 0 this <unk> the networks and studios to work it out on their own . 
And at the FCC , meanwhile , new Chairman Alfred C. <unk> has said 0 he wants the two sides to <unk> out their own plan . 
<unk> Equipment Inc. said 0 it settled a civil action filed * against it by the federal government on behalf of the U.S. Postal Service . 
The government sued the company in April , * seeking $ <unk> *U* and other unspecified damages related * to an alleged <unk> scheme . 
The suit named the company , former chief executive officer William G. Moore Jr. , former vice president Robert W. <unk> and five defendants who *T* were n't part of the company . 
The suit charged the defendants with * causing Peter E. <unk> , an <unk> of the Postal Service board of governors , to accept $ <unk> *U* in <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . 
Mr. <unk> was previously sentenced to four years in prison and fined $ <unk> *U* for his role in the scheme . 
In the agreement , <unk> agreed * to pay the government $ 20,000 *U* in return for the release of all claims against the company , Mr. Moore and Mr. <unk> . 
The five additional defendants were n't parties to the settlement . 
A trial on criminal allegations against the company and the same two former executives began Sept. 27 in federal court for the District of Columbia . 
They were indicted * last October on charges of fraud , theft and conspiracy related * to an effort * to win $ 400 million *U* in Postal Service equipment contracts by the maker of data management equipment . 
The company and its executives deny the charges . 
In a related development , <unk> Equipment said 0 the Postal Service has barred the company from * bidding on postal contracts for an additional 120 days . 
The Postal Service originally suspended the company Oct. 7 , 1988 , and has been <unk> the ban ever since . 
The company said 0 it will continue * to pursue a lifting of the suspension . 
Intel Corp. reported a 50 % drop in third-quarter net income , partly because of a one-time charge for discontinued operations . 
The big semiconductor and computer maker , said 0 it had net of $ 72 million *U* , or 38 cents , down 50 % from $ <unk> million *U* , or 78 cents a share . 
The lower net included a charge of $ 35 million *U* , equal to 12 cents a share on an after-tax basis , for the cost of * abandoning a <unk> joint venture with Siemens AG of West Germany . 
<unk> also fell from the year-ago period because of slowing <unk> demand . 
Sales amounted to $ <unk> million *U* , down 1.7 % from $ <unk> million *U* . 
Intel 's stock rose in early over-the-counter trading Friday , as investors appeared relieved that the company 's income from continuing operations was only slightly below the second quarter 's earnings of $ <unk> million *U* , or 53 cents a share , and that sales actually exceeded the $ <unk> million *U* for the second period . 
But Intel later <unk> to the stock market 's plunge , * closing at $ <unk> *U* , down $ <unk> *U* . 
In August , Intel warned that third-quarter earnings might be `` flat to down '' from the previous period 's because of slowing sales growth of its <unk> microprocessor , start-up costs associated * with a line of computers and costs of * preparing for mass shipments of the company 's new <unk> chip in the current quarter . 
On Friday , Andrew <unk> , Intel president and chief executive officer , said 0 `` Intel 's business is strong . 
Our <unk> improved as the quarter <unk> and September was especially good . 
For the full quarter , our <unk> were higher than the previous quarter , and our <unk> ratio exceeded <unk> . '' 
For the nine-month period , Intel reported net of $ <unk> million *U* , or $ <unk> *U* a share , down 27 % from $ <unk> million *U* , or $ <unk> *U* a share . 
Revenue amounted to $ <unk> billion *U* , up slightly from $ <unk> billion *U* . 
Walter <unk> and the African National Congress came home yesterday . 
After 26 years in prison , Mr. <unk> , the <unk> former <unk> of the <unk> movement , was dropped * off at his house by a prison services ' van just as the sun was coming up . 
At the same time , six ANC colleagues , five of whom *T* were arrested * with him in 1963 and sentenced * to life <unk> , were <unk> * with their families at various places around the country . 
And as the <unk> men returned to their homes , the ANC , <unk> in South Africa since 1960 and still considered * to be the chief public enemy by the white government , <unk> returned to the streets of the country 's black <unk> . 
A huge ANC flag , with black , green and gold <unk> , was <unk> * over the <unk> <unk> at Mr. <unk> 's modest house , while on the street out front , boys displayed the ANC colors on their shirts , caps and <unk> . 
At the small <unk> home of <unk> <unk> , a leading ANC <unk> and a former commander in the group 's armed wing , <unk> we <unk> , <unk> stuck little ANC <unk> in their hair and a man <unk> on an <unk> <unk> <unk> * in ANC <unk> . 
`` I am happy * to see the spirit of the people , '' said *T* Mr. <unk> , * looking <unk> in a new gray suit . 
As the crowd outside his home <unk> `` ANC , ANC , '' the old man shot his <unk> into the air . 
`` I 'm inspired * by the mood of the people . '' 
Under the laws of the land , the ANC remains an illegal organization , and its headquarters are still in <unk> , <unk> . 
But the <unk> release of the seven leaders , who *T* once formed the intellectual and <unk> core of the ANC , is a de <unk> <unk> of the movement and the <unk> of its internal wing . 
`` The government can never put the ANC back into the bottle again , '' said *T* <unk> <unk> , a veteran <unk> activist on hand * to welcome Mr. <unk> . 
`` Things have gone too far for the government to stop them now . 
There 's no * turning back . '' 
There was certainly no * stopping the tide of ANC <unk> last night , when hundreds of people <unk> into the <unk> Cross <unk> Church in <unk> for what *T* became the first ANC rally in the country in 30 years *T* . 
<unk> <unk> of `` ANC '' and `` <unk> we <unk> '' <unk> the church as the seven aging men vowed that the ANC would continue its fight against the government and the policies of racial <unk> on all <unk> , including the armed struggle . 
And they called on the government * to release Nelson <unk> , the ANC 's leading figure , who *T* was <unk> with them and remains in prison . 
Without him , said 0 *T* Mr. <unk> , the <unk> of the others `` is only a <unk> . '' 
President <unk> de <unk> released the ANC men -- along with one of the founding members of the Pan <unk> Congress , a rival <unk> group -- as part of his efforts * to create a climate of trust and peace in which his government can begin negotiations with black leaders over a new constitution aimed * at * giving blacks a voice in national government *T* . 
But Pretoria may instead be creating a climate for more turmoil and uncertainty in this <unk> divided country . 
As other <unk> governments , particularly Poland and the Soviet Union , have recently discovered , initial steps * to open up society can create a momentum for radical change that *T* becomes difficult <unk> , if not impossible <unk> , * to control . 
As the days go by , the South African government will be ever more hard pressed * to justify the continued <unk> of Mr. <unk> as well as the continued banning of the ANC and enforcement of the state of emergency . 
If it does n't yield on these matters , and eventually begin talking directly to the ANC , the expectations and promise raised * by yesterday 's releases will turn to <unk> and unrest . 
If it does , the large number of right-wing whites , who *T* oppose any concessions to the black majority , will step up their <unk> and threats * to take matters into their own hands . 
The newly released ANC leaders also will be under enormous pressure . 
The government is watching closely * to see if their presence in the <unk> leads to increased <unk> protests and violence ; if it does , Pretoria will use this as a reason 0 * to keep Mr. <unk> behind bars *T* . 
Pretoria has n't forgotten why they were all sentenced to life <unk> in the first place : for <unk> and conspiracy to <unk> the government . 
In addition , the government is <unk> that the releases could create a split between the internal and external wings of the ANC and between the newly freed leaders and those activists who *T* have emerged as leaders inside the country during their <unk> . 
In order * to head off any divisions , Mr. <unk> , in a meeting with his colleagues before they were released * , instructed them * to report to the ANC headquarters in <unk> as soon as possible . 
The men also will be faced * with * <unk> the generation gap between themselves and the country 's many <unk> black <unk> , the so-called young <unk> who *T* are anxious * to see the old <unk> in action . 
Says Peter <unk> , president of the South African <unk> Congress : `` We will be expecting them to act like leaders of the ANC . '' 
They never considered themselves to be anything else . 
At last night 's rally , they called on their followers * to be firm , yet <unk> , in their opposition to apartheid . 
`` We emphasize discipline because we know that the government is very , very sensitive , '' said *T* Andrew <unk> , another early <unk> leader who *T* is now 63 . 
`` We want * to see Nelson <unk> and all our <unk> out of prison , and if we are n't <unk> * we may not see them here with us .
