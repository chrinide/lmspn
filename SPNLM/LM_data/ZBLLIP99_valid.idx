People in Glass houses tend * to look <unk> . 
And , if still <unk> at the evening 's end , you notice something else : The audience , at first <unk> and <unk> by the music , releases its <unk> feelings in collective <unk> . 
Currently in the middle of a <unk> , <unk> tour as a <unk> <unk> , Mr. Glass has left behind his <unk> , equipment and <unk> in favor of * going it alone . 
He sits down at the piano and plays . 
And * plays . 
Either one likes it or one does n't *?* . 
The typical Glass audience , which *T* is more likely * to be composed * of music students than their teachers , certainly does *?* . 
The work , though , sounds like <unk> for <unk> . 
Philip Glass is the <unk> <unk> , and his music the new clothes <unk> , of the <unk> . 
His success is easy 0 * to understand *T* . 
* <unk> introducing and explaining his pieces , Mr. Glass looks and sounds more like a <unk> <unk> describing his work than a classical <unk> playing a <unk> . 
The piano <unk> , which *T* have been labeled * <unk> as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , cyclical , <unk> and <unk> , are <unk> <unk> -LRB- therefore <unk> -RRB- , <unk> <unk> -LRB- therefore <unk> -RRB- , and <unk> <unk> but <unk> -LRB- therefore both pretty and <unk> -RRB- . 
It is music for people who *T* want * to hear something different but do n't want * to work especially hard at the task . 
It is <unk> listening for the now generation . 
Mr. Glass has <unk> the famous <unk> <unk> `` less is more . '' 
His more is always less . 
Far from * being <unk> , the music <unk> <unk> us with apparent <unk> not so <unk> <unk> * in the <unk> of <unk> time , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> . 
But the music has its <unk> , and Mr. Glass has <unk> his <unk> program around a move from the simple to the relatively complex . 
`` <unk> '' -LRB- 1981 -RRB- , from <unk> , <unk> the audience to the Glass technique : * Never <unk> too far from the piano 's center , Mr. Glass works in the two <unk> on either side of middle C , and his <unk> seldom leave the <unk> . 
There is a <unk> musical style here , but not a particular performance style . 
The music is not especially <unk> ; indeed , it <unk> 's hard * to imagine a bad performance of it . 
Nothing <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> <unk> problems challenge the <unk> . 
We hear , we may think , inner voices , but they all seem * to be saying the same thing . 
With `` <unk> News , '' music meant * to <unk> <unk> of Allen <unk> 's `` <unk> <unk> <unk> , '' Mr. Glass gets going . 
His hands sit <unk> apart on the <unk> . 
<unk> <unk> make you feel as though he may break into a -LRB- very slow -RRB- <unk> <unk> . 
The <unk> <unk> , but there is little <unk> even though his <unk> begin * to <unk> over more of the <unk> . 
<unk> <unk> <unk> : First the music is loud , then it becomes soft , then -LRB- you realize -RRB- it becomes <unk> again . 
`` The Fourth <unk> <unk> , '' an <unk> from `` Einstein on the Beach , '' is like a <unk> but it does n't seem * to move much beyond its <unk> ground in `` Three <unk> <unk> . '' 
When Mr. Glass decides * to get really fancy *T* , he <unk> his hands and hits a <unk> <unk> note with his right hand . 
He does this in at least three of his <unk> pieces . 
You might call it a <unk> or a <unk> <unk> . 
In `` <unk> <unk> , '' which *T* came from a commission * to write a piece of <unk> length -LRB- Mr. Glass <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> that `` this was no problem for me '' -RRB- , an A section <unk> with a B section several times before the piece ends <unk> . 
Not only is the typical <unk> <unk> , it is also often multiple in its context -LRB- <unk> -RRB- . 
`` <unk> <unk> '' began its life as the <unk> to the <unk> <unk> 's first public address in the U.S. , when Mr. Glass played it on the <unk> at New York 's <unk> of St. John the <unk> *T* . 
Later it was performed * on Radio <unk> in Germany , and then <unk> <unk> took it for one of her dance pieces . 
The point is that any piece can be used * as background music for virtually anything . 
The evening ended with Mr. Glass 's `` <unk> , '' another multiple work . 
<unk> 1 , 2 , and 5 come from the <unk> of <unk> Morris 's <unk> film , `` The <unk> Blue Line , '' and the two other parts from <unk> music to two separate <unk> of the <unk> story of the same name . 
When * used * as background in this way *T* , the music has an appropriate <unk> , as when a <unk> phrase , a <unk> minor third , <unk> the seemingly <unk> <unk> of reports , interviews and <unk> of witnesses in the Morris film . 
* <unk> * up as a <unk> , however , the music lacks the <unk> provided * by a context within another medium . 
<unk> of Mr. Glass may agree with the critic Richard <unk> 's sense that the 1974 `` Music in <unk> <unk> '' is as <unk> and <unk> as `` The <unk> <unk> . '' 
But while * making the obvious point that both <unk> develop variations from themes , this comparison <unk> the <unk> <unk> nature of Mr. Glass 's music . 
Its supposedly <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> that *T* makes one <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , the <unk> radical <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , and what in <unk> even *T* seems like <unk> in <unk> . 
Mr. <unk> is professor of English at Southern <unk> University and editor of the Southwest Review . 
Honeywell Inc. said 0 it hopes * to complete shortly the first of two sales of shares in its Japanese joint venture , <unk> , for about $ 280 million *U* .

Proceeds of the sale , expected * to be completed * next week , would be used * * to repurchase as many as 10 million shares of Honeywell stock , the company said 0 *T* . 
Honeywell said 0 it is negotiating the sale of a second stake in <unk> , but indicated 0 it intends * to hold at least 20 % of the joint venture 's stock long term . 
A 20 % stake would allow Honeywell to include <unk> earnings in its results . 
Honeywell previously said 0 it intended * to reduce its holding in the Japanese concern as part of a restructuring plan which also *T* calls for a reduction of dependence on weapons sales . 
Yesterday a spokeswoman said 0 the company was `` pleased with our progress '' in that regard and `` hopes * to provide additional details soon . '' 
Honeywell said 0 its Defense and Marine Systems group incurred delays in * shipping some undisclosed contracts during the third quarter , resulting in lower operating profit for that business . 
Overall , Honeywell reported earnings of $ <unk> million *U* , or $ <unk> *U* a share , for the three months ended Oct. 1 compared with a loss of $ <unk> million *U* , or 98 cents a share , a year earlier . 
The previous period 's results included a $ 108 million *U* pretax charge related * to <unk> contract costs and a $ 12.3 million *U* pretax gain on real estate sales . 
Sales for the latest quarter were flat , at $ <unk> billion *U* . 
For the nine months , Honeywell reported earnings of $ <unk> million *U* , or $ <unk> *U* a share , compared with earnings of $ <unk> million *U* , or $ <unk> *U* a share , a year earlier . 
Sales declined slightly to $ <unk> billion *U* . 
Once again , your editorial page <unk> the law 0 *T* to <unk> to your almost <unk> <unk> . 
In an <unk> of little <unk> to his central point about private enforcement suits by environmental groups , Michael S. <unk> <unk> your readers , `` <unk> the <unk> Water Act is written * upon the <unk> -- the <unk> , rather -- that nothing but zero risk will do ; it <unk> a legal standard of zero <unk> '' -LRB- `` <unk> Environmental <unk> , '' Sept. 18 -RRB- . 
This statement surely <unk> your editorial <unk> that environmental protection is generally <unk> or excessive , but it is simply wrong . 
The <unk> Water Act contains no `` legal standard '' of zero <unk> . 
It requires that `` <unk> of <unk> '' into the `` waters of the United States '' be authorized * by permits that *T* reflect the <unk> limitations developed * under section <unk> . 
Whatever *T* may be the problems with this system , it <unk> reflects `` zero risk '' or `` zero <unk> . '' 
Perhaps Mr. <unk> was confused * by Congress 's <unk> statement of `` the national goal '' in section 101 , which indeed *T* calls for the elimination of <unk> -- by 1985 , no less . 
This <unk> statement was not taken * seriously when * enacted * in 1972 *T* , and should not now be confused * with the <unk> provisions of the statute . 
Thus , you do the public a great <unk> when Mr. <unk> suggests , even <unk> , that the <unk> Water Act prohibits the preparation of a <unk> and water *T* ; your <unk> readers may be led * to believe that nothing but chance or oversight protects them , as they <unk> in the night with their <unk> and waters , from the <unk> <unk> of the Sierra Club at their doors .

National <unk> , the <unk> U.S. magazine , is attracting more readers than ever and offers the <unk> , <unk> pages that upscale advertisers love *T* . 
So why did advertising pages plunge by almost 10 % and ad revenue by 7.2 % in the first half *T* ? 
* To hear advertisers tell it , the magazine just has n't kept up with the times . 
Despite renewed interest by the public in such topics as the environment and the Third World , it has n't been able * to shake its reputation as a magazine 0 boys like * to <unk> through *T* in search of <unk> <unk> women . 
<unk> , it lagged behind competitors in * offering <unk> <unk> , from regional <unk> to discounts for frequent advertisers . 
But now , the magazine is attempting * to fight back , with an ambitious plan including a <unk> sales strategy and a surprisingly aggressive ad campaign . 
<unk> do n't think of the magazine first , says 0 *T* <unk> <unk> , who *T* joined in April as national advertising director . 
`` What we want * to do *T* is * take a more aggressive stance . 
People did n't believe 0 we were in tune with the marketplace , and in many ways we were n't *?* . '' 
The <unk> magazine has never had * to <unk> advertisers with quite so much <unk> before . 
It largely <unk> on its <unk> <unk> : 10.8 million subscribers in the first half , up from 10.5 million a year ago ; an average age of 42 for readers -- at the <unk> of their <unk> years ; loyalty to the tune of an 85 % average <unk> renewal rate . 
The magazine had its best year yet in 1988 , when it celebrated its <unk> *T* and <unk> up a 17 % gain in ad pages , to <unk> *T* . 
But this year , when the <unk> surrounding its <unk> died *T* , so too did *T* some <unk> interest . 
The reason , ad executives say 0 *T* , is that the entire magazine business has been soft -- and National <unk> has some <unk> that *T* make it especially <unk> during a soft market . 
Perhaps the biggest of those factors is its high ad prices -- $ <unk> *U* for a <unk> page , vs. $ <unk> *U* for the <unk> , a comparable publication with a far smaller circulation . 
When ad dollars are tight *T* , the high page cost is a major <unk> for advertisers , who generally *T* want * to appear regularly in a publication or not at all . 
Even though National <unk> offers far more readers than does a magazine like <unk> *?* , `` the page costs you an arm and a leg * to develop any <unk> , '' says 0 *T* Harry Glass , New York media manager for <unk> <unk> . 
* To combat that problem , National <unk> , like other magazines , began * offering regional <unk> allowing advertisers to appear in only a portion of its magazines -- for example , ads can run only in the magazines sent * to subscribers in the largest 25 markets . 
But the magazine was slower <unk> than its competitors * to come up with its regional <unk> , and until last year offered fewer of them than did competitors *?* . 
Time magazine , for example , has more than 100 separate <unk> going to different regions , top management , and other groups . 
Another sticking point for advertisers was National <unk> 's tradition of * <unk> its ads together , usually at the beginning or end of the magazine , rather than spreading ads out among its articles , as most magazines do *?* . 
And National <unk> 's <unk> size means extra production costs for advertisers . 
But Ms. <unk> says 0 the magazine is fighting back . 
It now offers 30 regional <unk> , it very recently began * running ads adjacent to articles , and it has been <unk> up its sales force . 
And it just launched a promotional campaign 0 *T* to tell chief executives , marketing directors , and media executives just that . 
The <unk> of the promotion is its new ad campaign , into which the magazine will <unk> about $ 500,000 *U* , mostly in the next few weeks *T* . 
The campaign , created * by <unk> Group 's <unk> <unk> agency , takes advantage of the <unk> <unk> that National <unk> is known * for *T* . 
In one ad , a photo of the interior of the <unk> in Paris is <unk> * with the headline , `` The only book more respected than <unk> does n't accept advertising . '' 
Another ad pictures a tree <unk> , <unk> * 80 times , with the headline , `` For impact far beyond your size * consider our regional <unk> . '' 
Ms. <unk> says 0 she wants the campaign to help * attract advertisers in 10 categories , including corporate , financial services , consumer electronics , insurance and food . 
Her goal : * to top 300 ad pages in 1990 , up from about <unk> this year . 
Whether she can meet that ambitious goal is still far from certain . 
`` The ad campaign is meant * to <unk> the thought of National <unk> , '' she says *T* . 
`` We want it to be a <unk> kind of image . '' 
<unk> Plans <unk> <unk> 
<unk> Group hopes * to announce , perhaps today , an agreement * to sell the majority of its ad unit to Paris-based <unk> , a European ad executive said 0 *T* . 
<unk> has been in discussions with <unk> for several months . 
However , when negotiations <unk> down recently *T* , <unk> 's chief executive , Peter Scott , met in Paris with another French firm , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> . 
According to the executive , <unk> 's involvement prompted renewed <unk> in the <unk> talks and the two agencies were hoping * to <unk> out details by today . 
Executives of the two agencies could n't be reached * last night .

He was executive vice president , director of broadcast production . 
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission plans * to restrict <unk> trading on commodity exchanges , a move almost certain * to <unk> exchange officials and traders . 
The CFTC said 0 it will propose the restrictions after the release of a study that *T* shows little economic benefit resulting from <unk> trading and cites `` problems '' associated * with the practice . 
<unk> trading gives an exchange trader the right 0 *T* to trade both for his own account and for customers . 
The issue exploded this year after a Federal Bureau of Investigation operation led to charges of widespread trading abuses at the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange . 
While * not specifically mentioned * in the FBI charges , <unk> trading became a focus of attempts * to tighten industry regulations . 
Critics contend that traders were putting buying or selling for their own accounts ahead of other traders ' customer orders . 
Traders are likely * to oppose such restrictions because <unk> trading provides a way 0 * to make money in slower markets where there is a shortage of customer orders *T* *T* . 
The exchanges contend that <unk> trading <unk> liquidity in the markets because traders can buy or sell even when they do n't have a customer order in hand *T* . 
The exchanges say 0 liquidity becomes a severe problem for <unk> traded contracts such as those with a long time remaining before expiration . 
The CFTC may take those arguments into account by * allowing exceptions to its restrictions . 
The agency did n't cite specific situations where <unk> trading might be allowed * *T* , but smaller exchanges or contracts that *T* need additional liquidity are expected * to be among them . 
Wendy <unk> , the agency 's chairman , told the Senate Agriculture Committee that she expects the study to be released * within two weeks and the rule changes to be completed * by <unk> . 
The study , by the CFTC 's division of economic analysis , shows that `` a trade is a trade , '' a member of the study team said *T* . 
Whether a trade is done * on a <unk> or <unk> basis , the member said 0 *T* , `` does n't seem * to have much economic impact . '' 
Currently , most traders on commodity exchanges <unk> in trading either for customer accounts , which *T* makes them brokers , or for their own accounts as <unk> locals . 
`` The tests indicate that <unk> and <unk> traders are similar in terms of the trade <unk> and liquidity 0 they provide *T* to the market , '' Mrs. <unk> told the Senate panel *T* . 
Members of Congress have proposed * restricting <unk> trading in bills 0 *T* to <unk> CFTC operations . 
The House 's bill would prohibit <unk> trading in markets with daily average volume of 7,000 contracts or more , <unk> those considered * too difficult 0 * to track *T* without a sophisticated computer system . 
The Senate bill would force the CFTC to suspend <unk> trading if an exchange <unk> n't show that its oversight system can detect <unk> abuses . 
So far , one test of * restricting <unk> trading has worked well . 
The Chicago Merc banned <unk> trading in its Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index futures pit in 1987 . 
Under the rules , traders decide before a session begins whether they will trade for their own account or for customers . 
Traders who *T* stand on the pit 's top step , where most customer orders are executed * *T* , <unk> n't trade for themselves . 
A Merc spokesman said 0 the plan has n't made much difference in liquidity in the pit . 
`` It 's too soon * to tell <unk> but people do n't seem * to be unhappy with it , '' he said *T* . 
He said 0 he would n't comment on the CFTC plan until the exchange has seen the full proposal . 
But at a meeting last week , Tom <unk> , the Board of Trade 's president , told commodity lawyers : `` <unk> trading is definitely worth * saving . 
It adds something to the market . 
Japanese <unk> <unk> <unk> Car <unk> 
<unk> <unk> makers are trying * to set strict design standards for their <unk> . 
But some dealers are negotiating <unk> terms , while others decline * to deal at all . 
Nissan Motor Co. 's <unk> division likes * to insist that every dealer <unk> and <unk> a building in a Japanese style . 
<unk> include a <unk> <unk> <unk> at the center of each <unk> and a <unk> bridge <unk> a stream that *T* flows into the building from outside . 
`` <unk> has it down to the <unk> , '' says *T* Jay <unk> , a partner at <unk> Power & Associates , an auto research firm . 
Toyota Motor Corp. 's <unk> division also provides <unk> . 
But only two-thirds of <unk> dealers are <unk> new buildings according to the <unk> <unk> . 
Some are even coming up with their own novel designs . 
In Louisville , Ky. , for example , David Peterson has built a <unk> <unk> with the <unk> on the second floor . 
Yet some dealers have turned down <unk> or <unk> franchises because they were unwilling or unable * to meet the design requirements . 
Lee Seidman of Cleveland says 0 <unk> `` was a bear on <unk> '' but at least let him <unk> an existing building -- without the stream . 
Mr. Seidman says 0 he turned down a <unk> franchise in part because `` the building was <unk> but very expensive . '' 
* To head off arguments , <unk> offers dealers cash bonuses and <unk> construction loans . 
<unk> <unk> 's <unk> <unk> Back a <unk> 
<unk> <unk> have * to be first * to be winners . 
That 's the lesson offered * through one case study featured * in a design exhibit . 
<unk> Corp. was caught * off guard in 1974 when its main competitor , <unk> Office Products of Japan , introduced a <unk> <unk> <unk> half the size of standard <unk> devices . 
* <unk> * by patent protection from * following suit , <unk> decided * to go a step further and cut the <unk> in half <unk> again -- down to the length of a <unk> . 
By 1979 , designers and engineers at <unk> , a <unk> <unk> subsidiary , had produced a working model of a `` <unk> '' <unk> . 
By 1982 , however , the patent status of the <unk> <unk> had changed , * permitting <unk> to develop its own competitive <unk> system , which it did *T* . 
Marketing and sales departments then urged <unk> of the <unk> project . 
But others said 0 <unk> should proceed . 
Both were right . 
<unk> went ahead and introduced the <unk> in 1985 , but it has n't sold well . 
To date , says 0 *T* <unk> <unk> , a <unk> vice president , it has `` broken even or shown a small loss . '' 
Nevertheless , the device has been successful in other ways . 
It helped <unk> attract better engineers , and it provided new technology for other company products . 
The <unk> <unk> also helped * <unk> the company 's reputation from <unk> to <unk> <unk> . 
`` It <unk> gave me great pride * to see the <unk> of the <unk> in Japan look at the <unk> and shake his head and say <unk> <unk> , ' '' says *T* Mr. <unk> . 
<unk> 's <unk> <unk> is one of 13 case studies in the <unk> <unk> Project , sponsored * by the <unk> Management Institute of Boston and Harvard Business School . 
The studies are on exhibit at Harvard this month and will travel to Chicago 's Institute of <unk> and the University of California at Berkeley . 
A <unk> 's <unk> Means * <unk> Out

The harder he tried * to push them into large <unk> , the closer he came to * breaking the <unk> and <unk> his back . 
So Mr. <unk> , then vice president of the Alabama <unk> Association , took a <unk> garden <unk> and <unk> it to the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> about nine inches up . 
His crude device worked : The lower teeth gathered the leaves into a <unk> , while the higher , harder teeth moved the top of the <unk> . 
* Now incorporated * into a <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , or `` <unk> , '' also are supposed * to aid in * picking up leaves . 
One customer , Donald <unk> of Mobile , says 0 the <unk> <unk> allowed him to do his lawn in 2 <unk> hours , two hours less than usual . 
But other <unk> makers have their doubts . 
Richard Mason , president of Ames Co. in <unk> , W. Va. , says 0 the <unk> <unk> `` makes sense , '' but it would be `` tough '' 0 * to explain *T* to consumers . 
John <unk> , marketing director for True <unk> Corp. , a subsidiary of Black & Decker , says 0 people do n't want * to move a <unk> <unk> . 
`` They either pick it up , '' he says *T* , `` or they start * pulling from a fresh direction . ''

Four <unk> steel `` <unk> , '' each roughly in the shape of a `` <unk> , '' are attached * to the bottom of the box spring in a <unk> position <unk> . 
Nearly half of U.S. consumers say 0 they 'll pay up to 5 % more for packaging that *T* can be <unk> * or is <unk> , according to a survey commissioned * by the Michael Peters Group , a design consultant . 
The Pentagon is a <unk> house . 
* <unk> there for six years was really <unk> . 
The <unk> of the past are everywhere : They are kept * at <unk> only by * feeding them vast quantities of our defense budget . 
Some can be bought * off relatively <unk> . 
During the Korean War , Gen. Douglas <unk> demanded and got , in addition to his U.N. command in Korea , his own naval command in Japan , <unk> . 
Those <unk> operations cost less than $ 2 billion *U* a year , and keep Mac 's <unk> quiet . 
That 's about all 0 it costs *T* * to <unk> Adm. <unk> <unk> 's <unk> . 
In <unk> , <unk> and the German <unk> threatened * to attack the Panama <unk> , so we created the Southern <unk> in Panama . 
The Southern <unk> has grown even bigger since the war because <unk> 's <unk> sometimes runs through the E ring * dressed like Gen. Noriega . 
The <unk> 's huge bureaucracy is needed * * to analyze whether leaders of <unk> against Gen. Noriega meet the War <unk> Act 's six points , <unk> Weinberger 's seven points , the Intelligence Committee 's 32 points and <unk> Wilson 's 14 points necessary * to justify U.S. support . 
So far no one has *?* . 
The <unk> of the Soviet <unk> discovered * in Cuba back in the <unk> costs just a few hundred million : the price of the Caribbean <unk> in Key West that President Carter created *T* in 1980 . 
The <unk> has n't been heard from * since , but we keep the staff around just in case . 
George Marshall 's <unk> is much more difficult * to keep *?* happy . 
We keep a lot of <unk> to him <unk> around the Pentagon : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and such . 
The Army headquarters on the third <unk> of the Pentagon used * to burn a lot of <unk> to him , but the Navy headquarters on the fourth <unk> made them stop it . 
You see , Marshall had this thing about the Navy and the Marines -- he wanted * to make them part of the Army but Secretary of the Navy James <unk> blocked him . 
Now his <unk> <unk> n't let up <unk> it 's done * . 
* To keep him quiet we <unk> a new unified command <unk> every year or so run * by the Army or the Air Force and put more of the Navy and Marines under it . 
But we still hear him <unk> at night because the Navy has a few ships left , and * to satisfy him the Navy 's sea lift forces were given * to a new Air Force bureaucracy in Illinois , its space operations to another command in Colorado , the <unk> to a new Army bureaucracy in Fort <unk> , and the Navy 's Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf forces to an Army bureaucracy in Florida . 
Which *T* brings up the worst and <unk> <unk> of all -- the <unk> of the <unk> of Iran . 
When the <unk> died *T* , President Carter was so scared that the <unk> 's <unk> would blame him for * <unk> him out * to make way for the <unk> that he declared the Carter <unk> . 
Mr. Carter said 0 he would go to war * to stop anyone from * trying * to grab Iran . 
But that <unk> would n't settle for words , he wanted money and people -- lots . 
So Mr. Carter formed three new Army divisions and gave them to a new bureaucracy in Tampa called * the <unk> <unk> Force . 
But that <unk> was n't <unk> * ; he knew 0 the <unk> was neither rapid nor <unk> nor a force -- even though it cost $ 8 billion *U* or $ 10 billion *U* a year . 
After Mr. Carter was defeated * in 1980 , the <unk> 's <unk> claimed the credit and then went after President Reagan and <unk> Weinberger . 
I saw what he did *T* to them <unk> . 
It made my <unk> dance with <unk> . 
Why , he used * to lay in wait for <unk> ; suddenly he 'd leap from behind some <unk> of Marshall onto <unk> 's chest and grab him by the <unk> and <unk> him <unk> he <unk> up an additional $ 2 billion *U* or so . 
<unk> added four more divisions <unk> to the Army , two active and two reserve ; two carrier groups to the Navy ; a division -- equivalent to the Marines ; and the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and a thousand tactical aircraft to the Air Force . 
He bought $ 4 billion *U* in <unk> ships and $ 7 billion *U* in <unk> and equipment 0 *T* to fill them , and <unk> them at a new $ 6 billion *U* base at Diego Garcia in the middle of the Indian Ocean . 
He dedicated all these new forces to the Persian Gulf . 
One night both Marshall 's <unk> and the <unk> 's <unk> together caught <unk> and threw him to the ground . 
Before they let him go he added a thousand bureaucrats to the <unk> in Tampa and renamed it Central <unk> . 
He gave those bureaucrats charge of all naval operations in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean . 
Marshall figured 0 it would be good training for those soldiers -- someday maybe they would get the whole Navy . 
They had fun * moving the carriers around , but it turned out that they had forgotten all about mine <unk> . 
But the <unk> still kept * <unk> out at <unk> , so <unk> bought a hundred merchant ships more and $ 7 billion *U* of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , in order that those seven new Army divisions and three Marine <unk> could <unk> from all those new ships and aircraft and go to war in the <unk> mountains . 
Then suddenly <unk> 's <unk> came * to visit and said , `` What the hell are you doing *T* * planning for a land war in Asia 12,000 miles away ? 
We 'd get our <unk> <unk> * . '' 
Lucky for <unk> , <unk> was <unk> and soon went away , while the <unk> -- he kept * coming back . 
So the U.S. found itself * paying about $ 2 billion *U* in <unk> to various Arab <unk> for <unk> rights around the Indian Ocean . 
We had great success in <unk> . 
But then it turned out that President <unk> <unk> was not at all a nice person and the Navy pointed out that the base 0 he promised us *T* in <unk> had <unk> up about a hundred years ago and anyway was <unk> miles from the mouth of the Gulf . 
-LRB- But who *T* 's counting . -RRB- 
Still , <unk> was the best 0 we could get *T* , so we stay in bed with President <unk> . 
All these reports about him <unk> <unk> are probably exaggerated anyway . 
But would n't you know , now that we are spending <unk> of dollars , and have built those new divisions and new air wings , and have <unk> all these ships and supplies * to fight the Russians in Iran , the Russians seem * to have lost interest in the whole subject . 
Meanwhile , Congress is cutting huge <unk> out of the rest of the defense budget . 
<unk> , some Navy guys said : `` Do we still need * to keep all 18 Army divisions on active duty and all those extra <unk> aircraft without bases and all those Army guys playing <unk> in Tampa ? 
<unk> n't we save $ 20 billion *U* or $ 30 billion *U* a year by * shifting that stuff to the reserves ? 
And why not * save the costs of a thousand bureaucrats by * <unk> Central <unk> and putting responsibility for Gulf naval operations back where it belongs , <unk> with the task force commander in the Gulf ? 
And where were *T* all our <unk> paid Indian Ocean allies last year when our <unk> were being attacked * *T* ? '' 
<unk> like that really stir up Marshall 's <unk> . 
He appeared late one night in the <unk> of the new defense secretary , Dick <unk> . 
Marshall came * <unk> in like <unk> 's <unk> <unk> those chains of <unk> and air wings and links with Arab <unk> . 
He would n't leave until Mr. <unk> promised * to do whatever the Pentagon systems analysts told him *T* . 
So next day Mr. <unk> went out and did just that : He canceled the <unk> Navy and cut back one carrier and 20 <unk> . 
Then he canceled production of the Navy 's most important carrier aircraft , the <unk> and the <unk> . 
On the other hand , Mr. <unk> retained all those new land forces . 
Marshall 's <unk> is satisfied for now , but he 'll be back . 
What with <unk> coming and bigger defense cuts <unk> , more and more Pentagon bureaucrats are <unk> under their <unk> . 
They know that they can hold off the <unk> only a little while longer by * cutting carriers and ships . 
Then the whole thing will start * to collapse , just as it did *?* in the 1970s , and the <unk> and <unk> will be <unk> through the place * turning people 's hair white . 
* <unk> me the <unk> * just thinking about it . 
Mr. Lehman , a Reagan Navy secretary , is a managing director of PaineWebber .

For one thing , there is an old master <unk> on the wall -- `` Samuel <unk> David , '' a big <unk> <unk> painted * by <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> . 
At the moment , however , the painting is a <unk> <unk> of the problems that *T* have <unk> <unk> and its <unk> chairman and chief executive , David L. Paul . 
In an international buying spree that *T* began barely two years ago , Mr. Paul <unk> a collection of about 30 <unk> works , including the <unk> , at a total cost of $ 28 million *U* . 
By midnight Oct. 6 , all of the paintings were supposed * to have been sold * off , under orders from Florida 's comptroller , whose office *T* <unk> the state 's S&Ls . 
<unk> did n't meet the deadline . 
The collection was at the heart of a <unk> plan 0 Mr. Paul had *T* in which the art was * to do double duty -- as an investment for <unk> and as <unk> for the S&L 's new office tower , designed * by <unk> <unk> *T* . 
The <unk> is that the $ 28 million *U* was <unk> * from the funds of this federally insured institution even as <unk> was losing money hand over <unk> . 
Mr. Paul had no right * to buy art for the S&L in the first place -- it is n't on the comptroller 's `` <unk> '' list -- without * seeking a special <unk> , which he did not do *T* . 
Besides that , some of the paintings that *T* were * to grace the walls of <unk> actually ended up * hanging in the chairman 's estate on La <unk> <unk> off Miami Beach . 
Last spring , the comptroller 's office called a halt to Mr. Paul 's <unk> , * giving him six months 0 * to sell the paintings *T* . 
The acquisitions , officials said 0 *T* in a letter to Mr. Paul , were `` <unk> , <unk> and unauthorized . '' 
So far , Mr. Paul has <unk> but three of his <unk> , he <unk> n't say to whom . 
The comptroller 's office says 0 it is `` monitoring the situation . '' 
Though the agency could remove Mr. Paul , it has no current intention * to do that . 
`` It 's not like * selling <unk> , '' Mr. Paul says *T* , as he takes a drag on a <unk> St. <unk> cigarette . 
`` The last six months has established the quality of the collection . 
There 's no fire sale here . '' 
Despite Mr. Paul 's <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> <unk> is finding that * getting <unk> -- Florida 's largest thrift institution -- out of its <unk> investments is much tougher than * getting into them had been *?* . 
<unk> are just part of the picture . 
Although Mr. Paul has <unk> a $ 1.35 billion *U* junk-bond portfolio to less than $ 900 million *U* since April , the high-yield debt market has plummeted . 
* <unk> itself of what *T* is left * , as * is required * of all thrift institutions by July 1994 under the new federal S&L bailout law , may well prove difficult . 
And <unk> has other problems . 
Late last week federal regulators ordered the thrift institution * to stop * paying dividends on its preferred stock -- a move that *T* suggests deep concern about an institution . 
Mr. Paul has a plan * to bring in $ 150 million *U* by * selling off 63 of <unk> 's 71 branches , but it has yet * to be approved * by regulators . 
It <unk> is Mr. Paul 's art venture , however , that *T* has drawn the most attention from investors and regulators , not to mention <unk> throughout the world . 
<unk> shareholders -LRB- some of whom *T* are suing -RRB- say 0 the chairman and his collection <unk> the <unk> of speculation that *T* set off the national S&L crisis . 
-LRB- <unk> shares have fallen sharply in price from a high of $ <unk> *U* in 1986 * to close yesterday at $ <unk> *U* . -RRB- 
<unk> directors , meanwhile , say 0 Mr. Paul and others of his <unk> have left an <unk> mark on the art world -- and not for the better . 
<unk> do n't say `` It 's a van <unk> '' anymore , <unk> 0 *T* Harry Brooks , the president of <unk> & Co. , a New York <unk> . 
`` They say , <unk> <unk> <unk> got $ 53 million *U* for his , so certainly $ 10 million *U* is n't too much for mine . ' 
The great collectors 0 we <unk> on *T* , such as Paul Mellon or Norton Simon , have stopped * buying , and the new buyers are brilliant men who *T* made money in the stock market or in takeovers and rushed into collecting <unk> . '' 
Mr. <unk> , an art dealer and <unk> , sold Vincent van <unk> 's `` <unk> '' at a Sotheby 's auction in November 1987 to Australian businessman Alan Bond . 
-LRB- <unk> is , Mr. Bond has yet * to pay up , and until he does , Sotheby 's has the painting under lock and key . -RRB- 
When Mr. Paul moved in on the art market *T* , he let it be known that virtually no piece was too costly 0 * to be considered *T* by <unk> . 
He established his reputation as a <unk> in January last year at Sotheby 's auction of the Linda and Gerald <unk> collection in New York . 
There , on one of his first shopping trips , Mr. Paul picked up several paintings at stunning prices . 
He paid $ 2.2 million *U* , for instance , for a still life by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that *T* was expected * to fetch perhaps $ 700,000 *U* . 
The price paid * was a record for the artist . 
-LRB- Some 64 % of items offered * at the <unk> auction were sold * , at an average price of $ <unk> *U* . 
The rest were withdrawn * for lack of acceptable bids . -RRB- 
<unk> , Mr. Paul is said by Mr. <unk> * to have <unk> Mr. <unk> , the New York developer selling the collection , and <unk> . 
`` He says 0 he <unk> <unk> them , ' '' recalls *T* Mr. <unk> . 
`` And he tells me , <unk> If you want * to see your paintings , you 'll have * to come to my house in Florida . ' '' 
Mr. Paul denies <unk> and <unk> . 
`` It 's just not true , '' he says *T* . 
Mr. Paul quickly became more aggressive in his collecting , with the help of George <unk> , a Sotheby 's expert in old <unk> whom he met *T* at an exhibition of the <unk> items . 
Mr. <unk> , who *T* became his principal adviser , <unk> <unk> in London , Paris and <unk> . 
And , according to one dealer , Mr. <unk> had a <unk> for * introducing Mr. Paul with the phrase : `` He can buy anything . '' 
Nicholas Hall , the president of the <unk> U.S.A. Ltd. <unk> in New York , sold Mr. Paul `` Abraham and <unk> in the <unk> '' by <unk> <unk> <unk> . 
Mr. Hall says 0 Mr. Paul `` was known * to spend a lot of money . 
People were interested in * seeing him , but it was recognized * that the route was through Sotheby 's and particularly George <unk> . '' 
Mr. Paul thus developed a close , <unk> relationship with Sotheby 's . 
Mr. Paul was eager * to assemble a collection for the headquarters 0 <unk> has been moving into *T* for the greater part of a year . 
Sotheby 's , the auction house founded * in London <unk> and now under the umbrella of Sotheby 's Holdings Inc. , was hoping * to stir up interest in old <unk> as it <unk> * to build its U.S. business . 
European dealers continued * to dominate the action in old <unk> , which Sotheby 's North America had lately been <unk> *T* in this country . 
For several months , there was optimism all around . 
Last October , Mr. Paul paid out $ 12 million *U* of <unk> 's cash -- plus a $ 1.2 million *U* commission -- for `` <unk> of a Man as <unk> . '' 
The painting , attributed * to <unk> artist Peter Paul <unk> , was purchased * privately through Sotheby 's , not at auction . 
In March 1989 , just 15 months into his campaign , Mr. Paul was named * by Art & <unk> magazine as one of the top 100 individual collectors in the U.S. . 
`` * An unknown quantity to most of the art world , Paul is no <unk> to <unk> spending , '' the magazine said *T* , * noting that he does n't stop at paint on <unk> but also spends big on art 0 you can eat *T* . 
`` He recently bid $ 30,000 *U* at a Paris charity auction for a dinner <unk> * by six of the world 's great <unk> , but the final party cost closer to $ 100,000 *U* . '' 
-LRB- Mr. Paul says 0 it was n't that high . -RRB- 
The art collection might have come * to rival the <unk> ' had the Florida comptroller 's office not got wind of Mr. Paul 's <unk> <unk> . 
In its letter to him , dated * March 2 and shared * with reporters , Alex <unk> , the chief of the <unk> bureau in the comptroller 's office , expressed <unk> that the S&L could be so <unk> when it had reported losses of more than $ 13 million *U* in its two preceding quarters *T* . 
The state gave <unk> 30 days 0 * to sell the <unk> *T* . 
The comptroller 's office eventually extended the deadline to six months but <unk> its demands , * ordering that the `` book value of the collection -LCB- be -RCB- reduced to zero . '' 
In other words : * <unk> rid of all the pictures . 
The state <unk> noted that <unk> banking practices are grounds for * removing an officer or director and closed with the <unk> to Mr. Paul : `` * <unk> yourself <unk> . '' 
The state agency was particularly <unk> * to learn that the <unk> and a half-dozen other paintings listed * among the bank 's `` furniture and <unk> , '' were actually hanging in the chairman 's house . 
Mr. Paul says that at one point he did indeed have eight or nine of the paintings at home and that the rest were in storage at Sotheby 's . 
He explains that he was `` merely <unk> the paintings at home -- with some display -- because of the special <unk> environment '' required * for their <unk> , until <unk> 's new building was ready for them . 
Still , the incident was embarrassing . 
It came on the heels of a number of local newspaper articles suggesting that Mr. Paul has benefited <unk> from his association with <unk> . 
For instance , he got a $ 3 million *U* loan <unk> from the S&L , negotiated * at a <unk> rate . 
He owns 43 % of <unk> 's shares . 
* <unk> to Mr. Paul 's problems , dealers -LRB- some with <unk> interests -RRB- insist that he , relying rather too heavily on Sotheby 's advice , paid much too much for several pieces in the <unk> collection . 
The $ 12 million *U* <unk> * on the <unk> , for example , was a record price for the artist and maybe twice its value , given a dispute among scholars about its <unk> . 
David <unk> , the president of David <unk> Inc. , a New York <unk> , says 0 scholars question the <unk> of the <unk> . 
It may have been painted * instead by a <unk> associate . 
`` The feeling among many experts on the commercial side is that the price paid * at the time was excessive in any event , '' Mr. <unk> says *T* . 
`` It sounds like with the <unk> he got absolutely taken * to the <unk> . '' 
Victor <unk> , the executive director of the <unk> Association of America , agrees that Mr. Paul paid very <unk> for the <unk> and adds that * getting rid of it any time soon for a similar sum would be quite a <unk> . 
`` It <unk> 's not beyond credibility 0 the <unk> will someday be worth $ 12 million *U* , but whether it could be sold * for that amount tomorrow remains * to be seen * . '' 
Still , predicting is <unk> . 
`` I 'm forever <unk> * by what I see *T* making these high prices . '' 
Jonathan H. <unk> , the son of the painting 's former owner , Mrs. <unk> <unk> , <unk> the price talk as `` sour <unk> . '' 
Dealers <unk> of the purchase price , he says 0 *T* , were themselves interested in * buying the <unk> but lost out . 
Mr. Paul , for his part , <unk> the <unk> price , * saying 0 a lot of the experts have never seen the thing itself . 
`` Most of them were n't even born the last time 0 the painting was displayed * publicly *T* , '' he says *T* . 
Art prices are <unk> , but a good deal of <unk> is involved * in * <unk> statistics on sales . 
Salomon Brothers Inc. , the investment-banking firm , in its annual <unk> of investment returns , reported that old <unk> <unk> 51 % <unk> in the year ended June 1 , the greatest return of any of 13 assets 0 it tracked *T* . 
-LRB- <unk> and modern paintings , not tracked * by Salomon , are ranked * even higher at 74 % by Sotheby 's . -RRB- 
Salomon , moreover , gets its data on art appreciation from Sotheby 's , whose prices *T* go up with clients like Mr. Paul in its <unk> . 
The <unk> <unk> from consideration the many paintings that *T* go * <unk> at auction . 
Art indexes track winners , not losers . 
But art that *T* has fallen sharply in value is rarely put * up for sale . 
Also , at any of Sotheby 's auctions of old <unk> , roughly one-third to <unk> of what *T* is offered * does n't sell at any price . 
It 's not that there are n't any bids , but the bids do n't meet the minimum `` reserve '' prices set * by the sellers . 
In January , the <unk> painting that now *T* <unk> at <unk> was expected * to bring no more than $ 700,000 *U* at auction until Mr. Paul came along with his $ 1.15 million *U* . 
Mr. Hall of the <unk> <unk> says 0 $ 1.15 million *U* `` would have been an impossible price 0 for anyone to ask *T* for a <unk> four years ago . '' 
But from his <unk> point , it is n't that Mr. Paul , a customer of his too , <unk> for the work , `` a <unk> painting by an artist who *T* is not a household word . '' 
-LRB- The painting is 10 feet wide , seven feet high . -RRB- 
Rather , `` It just shows 0 things have changed . '' 
Mr. Paul boasts that he <unk> bargains in old <unk> just before they took an upward turn . 
`` They went up 51 % last year , and they 'll do it again this year , '' he declares *T* . 
`` They were a <unk> . 
Everybody was out * buying <unk> . '' 
Sotheby 's vice president <unk> <unk> says 0 the auction house has been `` <unk> '' Mr. Paul in * selling the paintings . 
And while Sotheby 's chief rivals in the art world , private art dealers , `` <unk> n't be happy * to hear it , '' she adds 0 *T* , `` a number of -LCB- the <unk> -RCB- have already been sold * <unk> , and at a substantial profit . '' 
Mr. Paul claims * to have sold three paintings , at more than a 10 % profit . 
That is n't 51 % , and the claim is n't <unk> * . 
He <unk> denies that he relied too heavily on Sotheby 's or Mr. <unk> . 
Mr. Paul says 0 he had not one <unk> but four <unk> advisers and that he never bid <unk> . 
After all , he had the counsel of `` <unk> from the most <unk> <unk> in the world . '' 
He says 0 he expects * to sell the collection -- including the controversial <unk> -- `` carefully and <unk> , just as it was put * together . '' 
But in <unk> <unk> , Mr. Paul 's holdings are `` <unk> . '' 
That is , he is being compelled * to put them on the market too soon , and has already gotten offers that *T* are less than he paid *?* for some of the art works . 
`` After a few years , you can argue 0 there has been natural appreciation , '' says *T* Susan <unk> , the publisher of Leonard 's <unk> Price Index of Art <unk> . 
But quick turnover in <unk> is `` like * <unk> your jewelry -- you end up with 50 % . 
People hold out and try * to get a bargain . '' 
Sotheby 's <unk> itself and Mr. Paul in the matter . 
Mr. <unk> says 0 Mr. Paul was a quick study who *T* worked <unk> and bought the best pictures available at the moment . 
`` On occasion , he paid a high price , '' Mr. <unk> concedes 0 *T* , but he says 0 those who *T* bid less and dropped out were dealers who *T* would then have marked up the paintings * to <unk> them at a profit to collectors . 
<unk> <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> at <unk> Associates in San Francisco , considers it <unk> `` <unk> conflict of interest for an auction house to both advise a client on purchases and to set price estimates on the paintings 0 *T* to be purchased * . '' 
Sotheby 's , she says 0 *T* , is `` wearing both <unk> . '' 
`` I <unk> n't see why there would be a conflict of interest *T* , '' says *T* Sotheby 's Ms. <unk> . 
`` <unk> are based * on the previous price of similar works sold * at auction and current market conditions , and are not affected by any knowledge of who the potential buyer could be *T* . '' 
<unk> , clients express interest in paintings but do n't end up * bidding , she adds 0 *T* , `` so we do n't know who the potential buyer will be *T* . '' 
Mr. Paul , in * selling off his paintings , is seeking at least a 15 % return on the bank 's investment , so as * to prove that the venture was sound . 
Mr. Paul says that he has <unk> out over much of the <unk> and that potential buyers from as far away as Japan and Italy have examined the collection . 
Because of the pressure <unk> on <unk> * to sell , dealers and collectors have been trying * to get the paintings at <unk> prices . 
But so far , Mr. Paul and his advisers are holding * fast . 
One dealer , Martin <unk> of French & Co. in New York , says 0 he `` would have loved * to buy '' a <unk> <unk> de <unk> painting from the bank . 
`` I tried * to steal the picture -- to buy it <unk> -- and -LCB- Sotheby 's -RCB- would n't do it . 
They were protecting his interests . '' 
Meanwhile , Mr. Paul and <unk> executives are getting <unk> about <unk> . 
Mr. Paul has been characterized * as `` the Great <unk> or something , '' complains 0 *T* <unk> E. <unk> , an executive vice president of <unk> . 
The media , she says 0 *T* , have <unk> his personal life . 
Mr. Paul <unk> in agreement . 
`` I do n't think 0 I have a life style that *T* is , <unk> , so <unk> , '' he says *T* . 
But at just that moment , he is <unk> * in his office by a <unk> in <unk> who *T* <unk> coffee from silver into a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> the <unk> with <unk> . 
Mr. Paul says , 0 yes , the ceiling in his executive <unk> is <unk> <unk> . 
The offices are done * in <unk> and <unk> <unk> , <unk> books and , of course , a $ 12 million *U* <unk> . 
But he <unk> that the <unk> be played * down . 
`` * Do n't say 0 it 's a gold ceiling . 
* Just say 0 the offices are <unk> appointed , '' he says *T* . 
`` Otherwise , the regulators will take it for <unk> , and <unk> everything 's got * to be <unk> . ''

Companies listed * below reported quarterly profit substantially different from the average of analysts ' estimates .

`` This is not a grossly <unk> market , but it 's not cheap either , '' says *T* George Collins , president of the mutual fund company T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore . 
According to Institutional Brokers <unk> System , Wall Street market strategists see only a 2.4 % jump in company profits in 1990 -- unlike in 1987 , when profits a year out looked good *T* -LRB- they did soar 36 % in 1988 -RRB- .

The common view , says 0 *T* <unk> Cohen , strategist for Drexel Burnham Lambert , is that there will be `` mild economic growth , modest profit expansion , and things are going * to be <unk> . 
Our view is that we may see a profit decline . '' 
Some think 0 investors should sell into rallies . 
The market `` is going * to wind down , '' says 0 *T* Gerald W. <unk> , a Chicago money manager . 
`` Things are a little less <unk> '' after Friday 's <unk> in the market . 
He expects stocks to decline an additional 5 % to 30 % , with the Dow perhaps <unk> out between 2000 and <unk> `` between now and June . '' 
After Friday 's decline , Mr. <unk> 's firm ran statistical tests on 100 high-quality stocks , * using old-fashioned value criteria devised * by Benjamin Graham , an analyst and author in the 1930s and <unk> who *T* is widely considered * to be the father of modern securities analysis .

Companies that *T* <unk> on debt in leveraged buy-outs during the past two years `` will continue * to surface as business problems . '' 
`` <unk> about value are n't useful , '' says *T* New York money manager John <unk> of Delta Capital Management .

Dean Witter now recommends 85 % , Goldman 65 % and Merrill Lynch 50 % . 
Some investors say 0 Friday 's sell-off was a good thing , because it <unk> a lot of crazy takeover speculation . 
`` It was a healthy <unk> , '' says *T* Michael Holland , who *T* runs Salomon Brothers Asset Management in New York . 
From here out , these investors see a return to old-fashioned investing , based * on a company 's ability * to show profit growth . 
`` The fundamentals are pretty strong , '' Mr. <unk> says *T* . 
`` I do n't see this as a bear market at all . 
It 's a recognition that there was much too much <unk> in the LBO market . ''

`` It was an <unk> to an event -LCB- the failure <unk> of a management and union group * to get bank financing for a takeover of UAL -RCB- that *T* does n't mean that much to lots of stocks . '' 
Many investors have <unk> worries , however .

That <unk> investors ' confidence in the economy and stocks . 
Not even all the brokerage firms see clear <unk> ahead . 
`` <unk> profits are likely * to get worse in the next two quarters , '' says *T* Mary <unk> , a market strategist at PaineWebber . 
She thinks 0 the market could drop about 10 % in the next few months , then recover and go higher . 
Companies with steady earnings growth could do well , she says 0 *T* , while others with high debt or poor earnings could see their shares decline far more than 10 % . 
The turmoil on Wall Street may benefit some retailers attempting * to lead leveraged buy-outs of their specialty and <unk> chains , investment bankers and retailers said 0 *T* .

Hooker is based * in Sydney , Australia . 
The combination of so many chains available for sale , the recent failures of such retailing LBO 's as Miller & <unk> Inc. and declining investor confidence will drive down prices , retailing observers said 0 *T* . 
`` The pricing will become more realistic , which *T* should help management , '' said *T* Bruce <unk> , a New York investment banker with <unk> S. <unk> & <unk> . 
`` Investors are n't going * to be throwing money at any of the proposed <unk> , but * doing deals on the basis of ridiculous assumptions never made sense , either . '' 
Earlier this year , bankers and other investors were willing * to provide financing because they assumed 0 there would be major gains in both profitability and sales , Mr. <unk> added 0 *T* . 
Those days are over now , he believes 0 *T* . 
`` <unk> from third parties who *T* have cash and are prepared * to buy has always existed and will continue , '' added *T* Mr. <unk> . 
`` But when prices were crazy *T* , it was even harder * to do an LBO . 
Bankers believed in the <unk> theory that *T* says 0 somebody else is always willing * to pay more . 
This is no longer true today . '' 
At <unk> Fifth Avenue , Paul <unk> , senior vice president , marketing , agreed that lower prices will help his management team in their proposed LBO . 
`` * Having * to take on less debt would certainly be an advantage , '' said *T* Mr. <unk> . 
`` It would also help us in our search for equity partners . 
* To make an LBO work , now we are going * to need more than just junk bonds . 
'' None believe 0 the proposed management <unk> will be easy * to complete *?* , especially at B. <unk> & Co. , which *T* is under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection . 
Not only could the Wall Street <unk> damp Christmas sales if consumers lose confidence in the economy , but potential junk-bond buyers are sure * to demand even stronger <unk> and greater management equity participation . 
Further , many institutions today holding troubled retailers ' debt securities will be <unk> * to consider additional retailing investments . 
`` It 's called bad money driving out good money , '' said *T* one retailing <unk> . 
`` Institutions that *T* usually buy retail paper have * to be more concerned . '' 
However , the lower prices 0 these retail chains are now expected * to bring *T* should make it easier for managers to raise the necessary capital and pay back the resulting debt . 
In addition , the fall selling season has generally been a good one , especially for those retailers dependent on apparel sales for the majority of their revenues . 
`` What *T* 's encouraging about this is that retail chains will be sold * on the basis of their sales and earnings , not liquidation values , '' said *T* Joseph E. Brooks , chairman and chief executive officer of Ann Taylor Inc. , a specialty chain . 
`` <unk> who *T* had good track records of * producing profits will have a better chance * to buy back their companies . '' 
Still , most retailing observers expect that all the proposed retailing <unk> will depend partly on the sale of junk bonds , a market already in <unk> , in part because of concerns associated * with bonds issued * by the Federated and Allied units of Campeau . 
`` Prices for retail chains are lower today than they were *?* last week , which *T* will help management , '' said *T* Gilbert Harrison , chairman of <unk> Inc. , an investment-banking firm specializing in retailing acquisitions . 
`` But the hurdle of financing still has * to be resolved * . 
<unk> bondholders will either look for greater equity participation on behalf of management , or insist 0 the equity component of the deals be substantially greater than in the past . 
Sony Corp. won a <unk> order blocking U.S. sales of <unk> Products Inc. 's `` My <unk> '' line of portable audio players for children .

A federal appeals court struck down a natural-gas regulation that *T* had prevented pipeline companies from * passing to customers part of $ 1 billion *U* in costs from controversial `` <unk> '' contracts . 
The court , in a <unk> ruling , threw out a deadline set * by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for * settling old contract disputes over gas that the pipeline companies reserved *T* but did n't use *T* .

But pipeline companies estimate 0 they still face $ 2.4 billion *U* in liabilities from <unk> disputes , including $ 1 billion *U* 0 they fear 0 they <unk> n't be able * to pass on to customers . 
According to industry lawyers , the ruling gives pipeline companies an important second chance * to resolve remaining disputes and take advantage of the <unk> mechanism . 
The court left open whether <unk> could <unk> a new deadline later . 
The court , agreeing with pipeline companies , found 0 the March 31 deadline was `` <unk> and <unk> '' and `` highly <unk> to the bargaining power of pipelines '' that *T* were forced * to negotiate settlement of the old <unk> contracts * to meet the deadline . 
A report last month by the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America found that pipelines ' settlement costs had jumped in the three months before the deadline to 39 cents on the dollar , from 22 cents on the dollar in 1988 . 
The court ordered <unk> to justify within 60 days not only its <unk> deadline , but other major elements of its proposed regulation for * introducing more competition into natural-gas transportation . 
The court also questioned a <unk> mechanism that *T* could be used * * to resolve <unk> liabilities .

And the Columbia , Md. , company may have * to settle for a lower price , he adds 0 *T* . 
Life is particularly <unk> for companies that *T* had planned * to go public this week . 
<unk> is becoming an investment-banking job requirement . 
Robertson , Stephens & Co. , a San Francisco investment banking concern , has a client that *T* looked forward to * making its initial public offering yesterday . 
<unk> of the company , a health-care concern , `` were very discouraged on Friday and felt 0 they should n't go public ; we felt 0 they should *?* , '' says 0 *T* Sanford Robertson , partner in the banking concern . 
As the market dropped Friday , Robertson Stephens slashed the value of the offering by 7 % . 
Yesterday , when similar securities rebounded *T* , it <unk> the valuation up again . 
As of late yesterday , the <unk> was still on . 
For many , the situation is especially <unk> because the market for <unk> was showing signs of strengthening after several years of weakness . 
`` We were just beginning * to look at the increase in <unk> , * seeing the light at the end of the <unk> , '' says *T* Frank <unk> Jr. , partner in <unk> <unk> , a Beverly Hills , Calif. , venture capital concern . 
`` But the <unk> 's just gotten longer . '' 
Companies planning * to go public `` are definitely taking a second look , '' says 0 *T* Allen <unk> , senior analyst at the Institute for <unk> Research , Fort Lauderdale , Fla. , which *T* publishes the New <unk> newsletter on <unk> . 
He <unk> that the recent market slide <unk> into a 5 % to 7 % reduction in <unk> proceeds to companies . 
Many companies are <unk> . 
<unk> Corp. had been planning * to sell 10 % of its stock this week in an <unk> that *T* would raise up to $ <unk> million *U* . 
But now , Peter <unk> , president , says , `` We 're making decisions on a day-to-day basis . '' 
* <unk> and profitable , the <unk> , Colo. , <unk> concern could borrow funds if it decides against an <unk> now , he says 0 *T* . 
<unk> Inc. , an Atlanta <unk> concern , says 0 it is still planning * to go ahead with its <unk> this week or next -- unless conditions change . 
`` It 's a <unk> situation right now , '' says *T* Terry <unk> , president . 
<unk> <unk> also would affect the operations of many companies . 
Sierra Tucson Cos. , a Tucson , Ariz. , operator of <unk> centers , has a planned doubling of capacity riding on an <unk> scheduled * for next week . 
William <unk> , president , says 0 he still thinks 0 the <unk> will succeed . 
If it does n't *?* , he says 0 *T* , the company would have * to change its expansion timetable . 
But the market turmoil could be partially beneficial for some small businesses . 
In a sagging market , the Federal Reserve System `` might flood the market with funds , and that should bring interest rates down , '' says 0 *T* Leonard T. <unk> , vice president of the Bank of New England , Boston . 
James G. <unk> , president of <unk> Savings Bank , <unk> , Mass. , says 0 the market turmoil `` is an absolute <unk> for small business . '' 
For small companies , he says 0 *T* , interest rates are far more important than what *T* happens on stock exchanges . 
Mr. <unk> thinks 0 rates are heading down , * helping small companies . 
Peter <unk> , biotechnology analyst for <unk> Securities International , Chicago , thinks 0 market uncertainty may encourage small companies to form more strategic alliances with big corporations . 
<unk> because the 1987 market crash made it harder for them to find financing , many high-technology concerns have made such alliances recently . 
Some even see a silver lining in the dark <unk> . 
Alan Wells , president of <unk> , Wells , <unk> & Co. , a New York merger specialist , thinks 0 <unk> investors may lose their enthusiasm for leveraged buy-out and giant takeover deals . 
Instead , they could turn to * investing in smaller deals involving smaller companies , he says 0 *T* . 
And William E. <unk> Jr. , a University of New Hampshire management professor and director of Venture Capital Network Inc. , says 0 the market 's <unk> will <unk> the investors ' lack of control in big stock investments . 
This will add to the appeal of small business , he says 0 *T* , where investors often have a degree of influence *T* . 
Bay Financial Corp. , hurt * by high debts and deteriorating real estate investments , reported a wider loss for the fourth quarter and said 0 it might be forced * to seek a <unk> reorganization if it <unk> n't <unk> its borrowings . 
Bay said 0 a `` substantial part '' of its debt outstanding is in default as a result of inability * to sell certain properties quickly and <unk> prices for sales made * . 
The company said 0 its real estate portfolio is `` highly leveraged , '' while about two-thirds of its investments are n't <unk> . 
Thus it is coming up short on a big bet that quick sales at higher prices would enable it to keep up with mortgage and other debt payments . 
According to its latest annual report , about a quarter of the company 's holdings are in Massachusetts , in the midst of a real-estate slump . 
The company said 0 it had a net loss in its fourth quarter ended June 30 of $ <unk> million *U* , or $ <unk> *U* a share , on revenue of $ <unk> million *U* . 
A year earlier , the company had a loss of $ 10.8 million *U* , or $ <unk> *U* a share , on revenue of $ 10.8 million *U* . 
For the year , it had a net loss of $ 62 million *U* , or $ <unk> *U* a share , on revenue of $ <unk> million *U* . 
In the previous year , it had a loss of $ 22.5 million *U* , or $ <unk> *U* a share , on revenue of $ <unk> million *U* . 
Although it is having serious <unk> problems , Bay said 0 the <unk> value of its holdings , minus debt , was equal to $ <unk> *U* a share at June 30 based on a recent <unk> . 
Book value per share , which *T* is based * on investments at cost , was a negative $ <unk> *U* a share . 
A year earlier , <unk> value per share was $ <unk> *U* and book value was $ <unk> *U* a share . 
Annualized interest rates on certain investments as * reported * by the Federal Reserve Board on a <unk> basis : 1989 and Wednesday October 4 , 1989 . 
<unk> , adjusted * for constant maturity . 
TRW Inc. reported a 12 % decline in third-quarter net income , but the company said that * excluding unusual gains in both quarters , operating profit rose 16 % . 
The electronics , automotive and aerospace concern said 0 third-quarter net was $ 60 million *U* , or 98 cents a share , down from $ 68 million *U* , or $ <unk> *U* a share , a year earlier . 
Share earnings are reported * on a fully diluted basis , by company tradition . 
Results for the 1988 quarter included a gain of $ 1.05 *U* a share from sale of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> Cable units , partly offset * by a charge of 69 cents a share for recall of faulty truck steering systems . 
The latest quarter included a gain of 11 cents a share as a partial reversal of the recall charge , because the reserve established * last year exceeded the actual recall costs . 
Sales for the quarter rose 8.3 % to $ <unk> billion *U* , from $ <unk> billion *U* , with all three major product groups reporting gains . 
The company said 0 aerospace and defense sales were up 2 % for the quarter to $ <unk> million *U* , and operating profit climbed 6 % to $ 61 million *U* , mainly because of improved program performance in <unk> and <unk> contracts . 
<unk> sales jumped 16 % to $ <unk> million *U* , mainly because of higher sales of air bags and other passenger restraint systems , TRW said 0 *T* . 
The group had an operating profit of $ 65 million *U* , against a loss of $ 13 million *U* a year earlier . 
However , * excluding the year-earlier charge for recall of steering gear , operating profit in the latest quarter declined 14 % , * reflecting higher start-up and product development expenses in <unk> systems . 
<unk> and production costs also rose , TRW said 0 *T* . 
The information systems segment had a 44 % jump sales to $ <unk> million *U* . 
An acquisition accounted for half the sales rise , TRW said 0 *T* . 
Operating profit rose <unk> to $ 18 million *U* , from $ 6 million *U* . 
For the nine months , TRW 's net was $ <unk> million *U* , or $ <unk> *U* a share , down 3 % from $ <unk> million *U* , or $ <unk> *U* a share , a year earlier . 
Sales rose 2.9 % to $ <unk> billion *U* , from $ <unk> billion *U* . 
a <unk> <unk> by an <unk> , not <unk> , though <unk> <unk> English <unk> in his <unk> -- proceeds as if the realistic English novel of <unk> , like <unk> herself , still ruled the waves . 
In fact , <unk> <unk> 's `` The <unk> of the Day '' -LRB- <unk> , <unk> pages , $ <unk> *U* -RRB- is both an <unk> to traditional English forms and a dramatic <unk> of them . 
It implies that the British Empire was <unk> * in its subjects ' minds , <unk> and <unk> , and argues , <unk> , that its <unk> <unk> were <unk> * in the defensive <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> and especially the <unk> of its domestic <unk> . 
As the <unk> Stevens , the <unk> <unk> of <unk> Hall , <unk> over such <unk> terms as `` <unk> , '' `` <unk> , '' `` service '' and `` loyalty , '' we see how <unk> <unk> <unk> the soul *T* . 
Stevens 's <unk> <unk> of the public and private <unk> -- like his <unk> master 's -- <unk> all 0 it was designed * to preserve *T* . 
Such <unk> <unk> the soldier . 
The <unk> cuts to the quick . 
It 's <unk> , the year 0 the Suez crisis marked the final end of Empire *T* . 
As he stands on a <unk> at the beginning of a <unk> motor <unk> from <unk> to <unk> , where a former <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> *T* , perhaps the victim of an unhappy 20-year marriage , perhaps -LRB- he hopes with more <unk> than he will ever acknowledge -RRB- not <unk> * to return to domestic service , Stevens surveys the view and thereby provides a <unk> , a <unk> and the author 's <unk> for the <unk> of the novel 0 we 're reading *T* : 
`` We call this land of <unk> Great Britain , and there may be those who *T* believe this a somewhat <unk> practice . 
Yet I would venture that the landscape of our country alone would justify the use of this <unk> <unk> <unk> . 
It is the very lack of obvious drama or <unk> that *T* sets the beauty of our land apart . 
What *T* is <unk> is the <unk> of that beauty , its sense of restraint . 
It is as though the land knows of its own beauty , of its own <unk> , and feels no need * to <unk> it . 
In comparison , the sorts of <unk> offered * in such places as Africa and America , though undoubtedly very exciting , would , I am sure , strike the objective <unk> as <unk> on account of their <unk> <unk> . '' 
An <unk> landscape ? 
An <unk> mountain ? 
But * let Stevens continue in his <unk> comic manner -LRB- his <unk> efforts at `` <unk> '' always fail -- most <unk> -RRB- : `` This whole question is very <unk> to the question that *T* has caused much debate in our profession over the years : what *T* is a <unk> great ' <unk> ? '' 
His answer is one `` <unk> * of a <unk> in keeping with his position . '' 
Such <unk> `` has * to do <unk> with a <unk> 's ability * not to abandon the professional being 0 he <unk> *T* . '' 
He `` will not be <unk> * out by external events , however surprising , <unk> or <unk> <unk> . 
<unk> are unable * to be <unk> because they are as a breed <unk> of the emotional restraint which only the English race are capable of *T* . '' 
Despite his racial advantage , * to be a great <unk> is a <unk> calling ; one 's <unk> is `` not unlike general 's headquarters during a battle . '' 
If , for example , in the midst of a great social occasion -LRB- such as an international conference on * <unk> the <unk> Treaty in <unk> -RRB- , one 's <unk> father , himself a great <unk> once , should happen * to die of a <unk> , one must continue * to serve the port : `` <unk> * do n't think me <unk> improper in * not <unk> * to see my father in his <unk> condition just at this moment . 
You see , I know 0 my father would have <unk> me to carry on just now . '' 
It is this kind of <unk> and restraint that *T* allows Stevens to declare : `` For all its sad associations , whenever I recall that evening today *T* , I find 0 I do so with a large sense of triumph . '' 
We note the <unk> public word used * * to deny private <unk> and <unk> . 
That Stevens himself is not <unk> or <unk> , but funny and sad and <unk> , is entirely the author 's triumph . 
Mr. <unk> 's ability * to create a <unk> <unk> voice that *T* permits him to explore such <unk> domestic , cultural and political themes was <unk> clear in his previous novel , `` An <unk> of the <unk> World , '' set * in Japan after the war . 
Now * shifting his scene from the country 0 he left *T* at five to the England 0 he has lived in *T* for nearly 30 years , he has <unk> a novel in the <unk> of Henry James and <unk> <unk> . 
With great <unk> he considers not only <unk> <unk> and -LRB- <unk> <unk> -RRB- sexual love , but British <unk> , the <unk> 's <unk> with democracy and support of <unk> , and the moral <unk> of loyalty : `` It is , in practice , simply not possible * to adopt such a critical attitude <unk> an employer and at the same time provide good service <unk> . 
<unk> This employer <unk> all that I find *T* <unk> and <unk> . 
I will <unk> devote myself to * serving him . 
' This is loyalty <unk> <unk> * . '' 
In the end , after * meeting with the former <unk> , Stevens sits by the <unk> at <unk> , * thinking of her and of his employer , and declares `` I <unk> . 
I <unk> in his <unk> 's wisdom <unk> . 
I <unk> n't even say 0 I made my own mistakes . 
<unk> -- one has * to ask <unk> -- what <unk> is there *T* in that ? '' 
The loyal <unk> has come full circle . 
What is <unk> *T* ? 
What is <unk> *T* ? 
We understand 0 such <unk> wisdom must be <unk> : The <unk> of <unk> only spreads her wings at <unk> . 
But as `` The <unk> of the Day '' so <unk> demonstrates with quiet <unk> , such wisdom can be <unk> <unk> * in art . 
Mr. <unk> teaches English and <unk> literature at Columbia University . 
<unk> Corp. said 0 its <unk> subsidiary completed the previously announced sale of its air separation plant and related assets in <unk> , Wis. , to <unk> Gas Inc. , Cleveland . 
The price was n't disclosed * . 
The transaction is part of <unk> 's continuing program * to shed <unk> 's industrial gas interests and expand the subsidiary 's <unk> business . 
Since June , <unk> has <unk> more than $ 100 million *U* from industrial gas <unk> and <unk> more than $ 50 million *U* * to acquire three <unk> distributors . 
<unk> is a gas and electric utility and distributes <unk> nationally through its <unk> subsidiary . 
<unk> <unk> , who *T* represents the Soviet airline <unk> here , has some <unk> that *T* are wild even by the current standards of perestroika . 
In his office <unk> the <unk> of <unk> Airport , Mr. <unk> <unk> <unk> out what he calls *T* `` just ideas '' : 
First , he suggests 0 *T* , <unk> Group Ltd. , the international aircraft leasing company based * in Ireland , could lease some of its Boeing <unk> to the Soviet airline . 
Then <unk> <unk> , the Irish flag carrier , could teach <unk> pilots * to fly the <unk> , and the fleet could be based * here at <unk> Airport . 
That 's not all , he says 0 *T* . 
<unk> <unk> , the Irish airport authority , could build a cargo terminal in the Soviet Union . 
<unk> could lease some of its cargo planes to <unk> <unk> , through <unk> , for a joint-venture cargo airline . 
And then there is his notion of an <unk> charter airline 0 *T* to <unk> <unk> to Los Angeles via <unk> . 
<unk> the <unk> of glasnost gone to Mr. <unk> 's head ? 
<unk> . 
The <unk> aviation connection is alive and well here at <unk> Airport . 
<unk> is indeed talking about * leasing Western planes to <unk> and even about * buying <unk> <unk> <unk> . 
<unk> <unk> is in discussions with the Soviet carrier about a cargo venture and other possibilities . 
<unk> <unk> already has so many ventures with <unk> that its chief executive is studying Russian . 
* <unk> as it may seem *?* , tiny , politically neutral Ireland has <unk> the <unk> Soviet airline bureaucracy . 
And as <unk> <unk> * to boost its service standards , upgrade its fleet and pursue commercial opportunities , the Irish aviation industry seems poised * to benefit . 
`` Irish and Soviet people are similar , '' says *T* Mr. <unk> . 
`` They look the same . 
They 're very friendly . '' 
Moreover , he says 0 *T* , Irish companies are small but <unk> . 
`` We have * to study their experience very well , '' he says *T* . 
`` We must find any way 0 * to get business *T* . '' 
The two groups have been working together since the late 1970s , long before Soviet joint ventures were the <unk> in the West . 
<unk> carried about 125 million passengers last year , and <unk> Airport , the airline 's largest transit airport outside the Soviet Union , saw <unk> <unk> flights and 250,000 passengers pass through . 
An apartment complex down the road is the <unk> and <unk> area for more than 130 <unk> pilots and flight attendants . 
The airport 's biggest supplier of aircraft fuel is the Soviet Union . 
<unk> from the <unk> port of <unk> each year <unk> 25 million gallons of fuel into a special tank farm at the airport . 
What <unk> does n't <unk> *T* into its own <unk> <unk> is <unk> * to the airport authority , which *T* <unk> it to 11 Western carriers including Air France , Trans World Airlines and Pakistan International Airlines . 
<unk> thus pays its landing fees , <unk> and <unk> bills with fuel , * <unk> its hard currency . 
That is n't all . 
Last year , the Irish airport authority , in a joint venture with <unk> , opened four <unk> <unk> shops at Moscow 's <unk> Airport . 
<unk> <unk> now manages <unk> sales on all <unk> international flights out of Moscow . 
<unk> shops in <unk> 's <unk> Airport opened in July , and <unk> shops in <unk> hotels and on the <unk> <unk> are coming soon . 
<unk> <unk> is talking about similar joint ventures in <unk> and in <unk> , a Black Sea resort , and even has a <unk> project cooking with the <unk> city of <unk> . 
<unk> 's international fleet of <unk> planes is being <unk> and <unk> * at <unk> Airport . 
* <unk> to a new air-traffic agreement and the ability <unk> of Irish travel agents * to issue <unk> tickets , tourists here are taking advantage of <unk> 's reasonable prices * to board flights in <unk> for holidays in <unk> , <unk> and Mexico City . 
The <unk> fare to <unk> is <unk> Irish <unk> -LRB- $ <unk> *U* -RRB- . 
<unk> costs <unk> <unk> . 
A formal <unk> of sorts was <unk> * on this <unk> in April when Mikhail and <unk> Gorbachev stopped here for talks with Irish Prime Minister Charles <unk> *T* . 
New trade accords were signed * . 
It all started with <unk> . 
When it opened in <unk> *T* , <unk> was the first <unk> in Europe for <unk> airplanes flying from North America . 
<unk> in aircraft fuel efficiency over the years made a <unk> stop unnecessary for most Western air <unk> , but <unk> still flies inefficient <unk> that *T* <unk> n't make it from Moscow to Managua on one <unk> . 
As a result , Ireland did n't <unk> the Soviets after they shot down a Korean Air Lines <unk> over the Sea of Japan in 1983 , though it suspended direct <unk> flights for two months . 
In fact , <unk> <unk> started * <unk> Russians from <unk> to New York when Washington stripped <unk> of its U.S. landing rights *T* . 
Today , <unk> <unk> is making a <unk> of money from its Soviet <unk> . 
And , with those contacts in place , it <unk> could be relatively simple * to add <unk> <unk> and <unk> to the team . 
Then , perhaps , Mr. <unk> 's ideas would n't sound like so much <unk> . 
Britain 's industrial production rose 1.5 % in August from July and was up 0.9 % from August 1988 , according to provisional data from the Central <unk> Office . 
<unk> in the energy sector , which *T* can vary greatly with swings in the oil market , rose 3.8 % in August from May but was down 7.1 % from a year earlier . 
The latest figures compare with July 's 4.5 % <unk> rise and 11.3 % year-to-year fall . 
When <unk> Corp. begins * shipping steel from the world 's first <unk> plant this month *T* , it will begin * testing the competitive <unk> of its giant competitors . 
The new technology , which *T* creates a very thin piece of steel , <unk> reduces the costs of * making <unk> sheets . 
An <unk> Kenneth <unk> , <unk> 's chairman , says 0 the company 's plant eventually will make a ton of steel in 1.5 man hours , compared with four to six man hours at a conventional mill . 
`` We 've had the Russians and Chinese , and people from India visiting us , '' Mr. <unk> <unk> *T* . 
`` Everyone in the world is watching us very closely . '' 
<unk> his neighbors , the major U.S. steelmakers . 
Already , USX Corp. and <unk> Inc. are studying <unk> 's technology * to see if they can adopt it . 
Says <unk> the chief executive officer of a major Midwest steel company : `` It 's <unk> <unk> . '' 
The <unk> steel industry is about * to be turned * <unk> by a 1990s technology revolution . 
New , efficient and sophisticated processes make it <unk> easier for smaller , less <unk> companies to make steel at a fraction of what Big Steel paid *T* decades ago . 
It also enables <unk> finally to get a <unk> in the <unk> steel market -- the major steelmakers ' largest , most <unk> , and until now , <unk> , market . 
But such <unk> technology is only the beginning . 
<unk> engineers <unk> <unk> and direct casting , which by the end of the 1990s *T* will enable production without <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> . 
Those massive structures , while * <unk> cost and environmental <unk> , effectively locked out all but <unk> giants from <unk> . 
`` There 's a revolution ahead of us that *T* will ultimately change the way 0 we market and distribute steel *T* , '' says *T* William Dennis , vice president , manufacturing and technology , for the American Iron <unk> and Steel Institute . 
It is n't that major steelmakers have <unk> ignored high technology . 
In fact , they 've spent billions of dollars * to boost the percentage of <unk> cast steel to <unk> % in 1988 , from <unk> % five years before . 
Moreover , their balance sheets are rich with <unk> , their old plants <unk> , and work forces lean . 
But that <unk> n't <unk> . 
`` It <unk> 's no longer enough * to beat the guy down the street . 
You have * to beat everyone around the world , '' says *T* Mr. Dennis . 
He wants * to see steelmakers more involved in computers and artificial intelligence . 
The problem : They 're <unk> with huge plants that *T* require costly maintenance . 
And * try <unk> new dollars free in a market that *T* is softening , hurt * by a strong dollar and concerned about <unk> -- the industry 's <unk> <unk> . 
`` The technology revolution is going * to be very threatening to established producers , '' says *T* Peter Marcus , an analyst with PaineWebber <unk> . 
`` They 've got too much invested * in the old stuff and they <unk> n't get their workers to be flexible . '' 
No one expects <unk> to <unk> major integrated steelmakers , who *T* remain the <unk> <unk> of <unk> steel used * for autos and <unk> . 
<unk> 's plant in <unk> , Ind. , ultimately will produce only one million tons <unk> annually , a drop in the <unk> <unk> steel <unk> , and it will be years before such plants can compete in the <unk> market . 
Still , <unk> is the steel industry 's bread and <unk> , * representing about half of the 80 million tons of steel expected * to be shipped * this year . 
Moreover , the process is n't without its <unk> . 
Because all operations are connected * , one equipment failure forces a complete plant shutdown . 
On some days , the <unk> plant does n't produce anything . 
`` At this point , the <unk> capacity <unk> n't make a great <unk> in the integrated market , but it does challenge them * to develop new markets , '' says *T* James <unk> , vice president , materials , at <unk> , a technology and <unk> giant based * in Columbus , Ohio . 
Indeed , with demand for steel not growing fast enough * to absorb capacity , steelmakers will have * to change the way 0 they do business *T* . 
In the past , says 0 *T* <unk> 's chief economist John <unk> , steelmakers made a product and set it out on the <unk> <unk> . 
`` We said : <unk> We 've got a product : if you want it , you can buy it , ' '' he says *T* , * adding : `` Now we 're <unk> out what people need *T* , and are going back * to make it . '' 
<unk> 's sales representatives visit the General Motors Corp. 's Fairfax assembly plant in Kansas City , Mo. , two or three days a week . 
When they determined that GM needed parts more quickly , <unk> convinced a steel service center to build a processing plant nearby so shipments could be delivered * within 15 minutes . 
* <unk> such relationships with major clients -- car and appliance makers -- is a means of survival , especially when those key clients are relying on a smaller pool of producers *T* and <unk> with plastic and aluminum makers *T* . 
For example , when Detroit began * talking about <unk> cars *T* , the American Iron and Steel Institute began a major lobbying effort * to show auto makers how they could use steel more efficiently by * simply <unk> how a car door is assembled * *T* *T* . 
But steelmakers must also find new markets . 
After * letting <unk> take the <unk> lead , a group of the nation 's largest steelmakers started a <unk> institute * to promote steel cans to an <unk> <unk> nation . 
<unk> 's Mr. <unk> thinks 0 steelmakers should concentrate more on construction . 
<unk> Steel Corp. , <unk> , W. Va. , for example , is <unk> to homeowners <unk> steel doors , with <unk> glass <unk> , as a secure and <unk> alternative to <unk> or aluminum ones . 
Other steelmakers <unk> steel <unk> covering <unk> . 
Still others are looking at overseas markets . 
USX is <unk> drilling pipe to <unk> Soviet Union . 
This year , the nation 's largest steelmaker <unk> its overseas sales operation . 
<unk> also are trying * to <unk> by * concentrating on <unk> output , such as <unk> and <unk> products , which *T* remain beyond the reach of <unk> . 
Almost all <unk> programs announced * by major steelmakers within the past year involve * building <unk> lines , used * * to produce steel for such products as household appliances and car doors . 
But <unk> , that segment is much smaller than the <unk> <unk> steel . 
`` It 's like everyone climbing out of the <unk> II and getting into a <unk> , '' says *T* John <unk> , an analyst with <unk> Consultants . 
`` After a while , someone has * to go over the side . '' 
Although he does n't expect any <unk> , he does see more plants being sold or closed * . 
Robert <unk> , with the <unk> Institute , agrees . 
`` Unless there is an enormous rate of economic growth or a further drop in the dollar , it 's unlikely that consumption of U.S. produced steel will grow sufficiently * to offset the growth of <unk> . '' 
Not to mention the <unk> of imports . 
Japanese and European steelmakers , which *T* have led the recent technology developments , are <unk> awaiting the lifting of trade restraints in 1992 . 
Moreover , the U.S. can expect more competition from low-cost producing Pacific <unk> and Latin American countries . 
A Taiwanese steelmaker recently announced plans * to build a <unk> plant . 
`` People think of the steel business as an old and <unk> <unk> business , '' says *T* Mr. <unk> . 
`` They 're dead wrong . ''

Polaroid Corp. 's <unk> damages case against Eastman Kodak Co. , one of the highest stakes corporate trials ever , is getting scant attention on Wall Street . 
After 78 days of <unk> testimony in federal court in Boston , the trial is being all but ignored * by analysts and patent attorneys . 
Most have read the <unk> documents , however , and estimate 0 Kodak will be ordered * to pay $ 1 billion to $ 1.5 billion *U* for * <unk> on seven Polaroid patents . 
That may be the largest patent award ever , but it is well below the $ 12 billion *U* 0 Polaroid seeks *T* . 
The highest patent damage award to date was in 1986 , when Smith International Inc. was ordered * to pay $ <unk> million *U* to Baker Hughes Inc. for * <unk> on a patent on an oil drilling bit <unk> . 
The two companies later agreed * to settle for $ 95 million *U* . 
Few analysts think 0 it <unk> is worth their time * to <unk> through the Polaroid trial testimony . 
`` It 's like * <unk> for gold outside of Grand Central <unk> . 
You might find something , but the chances are low , '' said *T* Michael <unk> , an analyst at Wertheim <unk> & <unk> . 
And Eugene <unk> , an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. , said : `` If you hired an attorney 0 *T* to be there all the time and give you a -LRB- prediction -RRB- of the eventual award , I would be willing * to bet that he would be off '' by a lot . 
A <unk> trial in the early 1980s determined that Kodak , based * in Rochester , N.Y. , <unk> on patents of Polaroid , of Cambridge , <unk> . 
The main issues remaining are how * to <unk> damages *T* and whether the infringement was `` <unk> and <unk> . '' 
If so , the damages could be tripled * . 
Two analysts who *T* have read the <unk> , David Nelson of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and <unk> D. <unk> , a litigation analyst at <unk> , Simpson & Co. , think 0 Judge A. David <unk> will decide in Kodak 's favor on the `` <unk> and <unk> '' issue . 
Mr. <unk> said 0 testimony by Kodak 's patent counsel , Francis T. <unk> of <unk> & <unk> , showed that `` he worked with Kodak <unk> from the <unk> of the project '' in an effort * to avoid infringement . 
`` <unk> told Kodak on many occasions * to avoid various features because of Polaroid 's patent positions , '' and Kodak followed his advice in every instance , Mr. <unk> said *T* . 
But Irving <unk> , a patent expert at George Mason University School of Law who *T* is familiar with the case , said 0 the fact that seven patents were <unk> * `` suggests 0 that infringement was <unk> . 
It <unk> 's difficult * to be that consistently wrong . '' 
<unk> also wonder whether Judge <unk> will use the <unk> method of * determining damages , which Polaroid favors *T* because it would result in a larger award , or the reasonable royalty method . 
Polaroid claims 0 it could have manufactured and sold all the instant cameras and film sold * by Kodak if Kodak had n't entered the market . 
Moreover , Polaroid contends 0 it could have sold them at a higher price -- and thus made higher profits -- because it would n't have been forced * to match Kodak 's lower prices . 
Each side has called a Harvard Business School professor 0 *T* to testify on that issue . 
Kodak hired Robert <unk> and Polaroid brought in Robert J. <unk> . 
`` There 's nothing that *T* says that people at Harvard Business school have * to agree with each other , '' said *T* Mr. <unk> . 
<unk> is expected * to continue until early December . 
A decision is n't expected * until some time next year . 
International Business Machines Corp. said 0 earnings tumbled 30 % in the third quarter , even a bit further than * expected * , * <unk> the outlook doubtful for the next few quarters . 
The main reason was a delay in shipment of new <unk> disk drives , a business that *T* accounts for some 10 % of IBM 's $ 60 billion *U* of annual revenue . 
IBM , which *T* <unk> the poor results three weeks ago , also cited an increase in its leasing business , which *T* tends * to lock in business long-term but cut revenue in the near term . 
In addition , IBM noted that the stronger dollar has cut the value of overseas revenue and earnings when they are <unk> * into dollars . 
Earnings fell to $ <unk> million *U* , or $ <unk> *U* a share , somewhat below securities analysts ' revised expectations of around $ <unk> *U* a share . 
That compared with the year-earlier $ 1.25 billion *U* , or $ <unk> *U* a share -- which *T* was inflated * by a <unk> gain from the sale of some MCI Communications Corp. stock and by an unspecified amount from a payment by Fujitsu Ltd. relating to a software dispute . 
Revenue climbed 4.3 % to $ <unk> billion *U* from $ <unk> billion *U* . 
IBM , <unk> , N.Y. , remained upbeat . 
The computer giant , whose U.S. results have been dismal for years , noted that revenue rose again in the U.S. in the third quarter , following an increase in the second period . 
The company said in a statement that `` demand for IBM products and services continues * to be good world-wide . 
We do not see anything <unk> in the fundamentals of our business that *T* would cause us to change our strategy of * investing for profitable growth . '' 
Securities analysts , however , remained <unk> . 
`` I think 0 1990 will be another <unk> year , '' said *T* Steve <unk> of First Boston . 
Jay Stevens of Dean Witter actually cut his per-share earnings estimate to $ 9 *U* from $ <unk> *U* for 1989 and to $ <unk> *U* from $ <unk> *U* in 1990 because he decided 0 sales would be even weaker than he had expected *?* . 
Both estimates would mark declines from the 1988 net of $ <unk> billion *U* , or $ <unk> *U* a share , which *T* itself was well below the record 0 IBM set *T* in 1984 . 
Mr. Stevens said 0 he kept a `` <unk> '' recommendation on the stock only because `` all the damage has been done * . '' 
He said 0 the stock has n't traded below 1 <unk> times book value <unk> over the past 10 years , which at the moment *T* <unk> to a stock price of $ 100 *U* . 
The stock closed yesterday at $ 103 *U* a share , up just $ 1 *U* in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange as the market surged . 
Analysts worry that the <unk> and leasing problems will last at least through the first quarter . 
`` A key part of the question is , how soon does this <unk> come *T* and how soon does production <unk> up *T* ? '' said *T* Steve Cohen at <unk> Financial Group . 
`` And the <unk> 0 I 've had *T* from customers is that it still could be a while . '' 
On leasing , Bob <unk> at <unk> Research said 0 he thinks 0 IBM has hurt itself <unk> . 
He said 0 IBM has priced its leases aggressively , * thinking 0 that would help * win business . 
But he said 0 IBM would have won the business anyway as a sale to a third party that *T* would have then leased the equipment to the customer . 
He said 0 IBM has not only hurt its short-term revenue outlook but has also been losing money on its leases . 
Bob <unk> , executive vice president of marketing at <unk> Inc. , a huge leasing firm , said : `` * To put it <unk> , IBM Credit has been doing some of the worst economic deals of any leasing company 0 we have ever seen *T* . '' 
IBM is expected * to get a boost soon when it <unk> some new versions of its <unk> . 
But the basic technology in the line is almost five years old , which *T* means 0 it is long in the <unk> , and competitors are rolling out strong products of their own . 
IBM is gaining momentum in the personal-computer market , and is expected * to introduce some impressive workstations early next year . 
But it <unk> 's hard * to squeeze much profit out of the personal-computer business these days , and the workstation market , while important , is too small * to rely on for much growth . 
The disk drives will <unk> sell well when they finally become available *T* . 
But the <unk> , IBM 's highly successful <unk> line , is losing its momentum , and some analysts said 0 sales could even decline in the fourth quarter . 
In addition , IBM 's growth in software in the third quarter was just 8.8 % , well below historical levels even when * adjusted * to reflect last year 's payment from Fujitsu and the stronger dollar *T* . 
And expenses , up 7.9 % in the quarter , have stayed <unk> high . 
In the nine months , IBM earned $ <unk> billion *U* , or $ <unk> *U* a share , down 8.4 % from the year-earlier $ <unk> billion *U* , or $ <unk> *U* a share . 
Revenue increased 6.5 % to $ <unk> billion *U* from $ <unk> billion *U* . 
PepsiCo Inc. 's chairman said 0 he is `` more than comfortable with '' analysts ' estimates that third-quarter earnings rose to at least 98 cents to $ 1 *U* a share from 91 cents the year earlier . 
D. Wayne <unk> , also chief executive officer of the company , indicated that he expects analysts to raise their forecasts for 1989 after the company releases its earnings today . 
So far , analysts have said 0 they are looking for $ <unk> to $ <unk> *U* a share . 
After today 's announcement , that range could increase to $ <unk> to $ <unk> *U* a share . 
The official said 0 he also would be comfortable with that new range . 
In 1988 , the soft-drink giant earned $ <unk> *U* a share . 
Results for 1989 will include about 40 cents a share from the <unk> effects of <unk> and bottling company acquisitions . 
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , the company closed yesterday at $ <unk> *U* a share , up $ <unk> *U* . 
The company said 0 third-quarter sales are expected * to increase 25 % from $ <unk> billion *U* of last year 's third quarter . 
Domestic soft-drink <unk> case sales are estimated * to have risen only 1 % in the third quarter -- well below the 4 % to 5 % *U* growth of recent years -- but about in line with the rest of the soft-drink industry . 
Mr. <unk> blamed the slower volume on <unk> weather , a <unk> of new products in the industry and -- to a much lesser extent -- pricing . 
PepsiCo said 0 its soft-drink prices were about 2 % higher in the quarter . 
Mr. <unk> also noted that soft-drink volume rose a hefty 9 % in last year 's third quarter , * making the comparison more difficult . 
International soft-drink volume was up about 6 % . 
<unk> <unk> increased a strong 7 % in the third quarter , while domestic profit increased in double <unk> , Mr. <unk> said 0 *T* . 
* Excluding the British <unk> business acquired * in July , <unk> international <unk> jumped 40 % , with sales strong in Spain , Mexico and Brazil . 
Total <unk> profit rose 30 % . 
* <unk> * by Pizza <unk> and <unk> Bell , restaurant earnings increased about 25 % in the third quarter on a 22 % sales increase . 
<unk> sales for Pizza <unk> rose about 13 % , while <unk> Bell 's increased 22 % , as the chain continues * to benefit from its <unk> strategy . 
<unk> Bell has turned around declining customer counts by * permanently lowering the price of its <unk> . 
<unk> <unk> for Kentucky Fried <unk> , which *T* has <unk> with increased competition in the fast-food chicken market and a lack of new products , rose only 1 % . 
The operation , which *T* has been slow * to respond to consumers ' shifting tastes away from <unk> foods , has been developing a <unk> product that *T* may be introduced * nationally at the end of next year . 
The new product has performed well in a market test in Las Vegas , Nev. , Mr. <unk> said 0 *T* . 
After a four-year , $ 7.7 billion *U* acquisition <unk> that *T* brought a major soft-drink company , <unk> <unk> , a fast-food chain and an overseas <unk> giant to Pepsi , Mr. <unk> said 0 he does n't expect any major acquisition in the next year or so . 
But , `` You never can tell , '' he added *T* , `` you have * to take advantage of opportunities . 
President Bush chose Martin <unk> , a longtime friend from Texas , * to be chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission . 
Mr. <unk> would succeed <unk> <unk> , who *T* is <unk> . 
The White House said 0 Ms. <unk> , a Chicago <unk> who *T* previously held posts at the Energy Department and <unk> , is leaving * to become a vice president of First Chicago <unk> . 
Mr. <unk> , an attorney in Midland , Texas , has been <unk> at the Interior Department . 
He met Mr. Bush in the 1950s , when the president was a young oil man in Midland *T* and Mr. <unk> was a lawyer for an oil firm *T* . 
The <unk> is a <unk> commission that *T* <unk> billions of dollars of interstate wholesale energy transactions . 
Mr. <unk> 's appointment is subject to confirmation by the Senate . 
Administration officials said 0 a date for Ms. <unk> 's departure has n't been set * . 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Corp. said 0 its directors declared a dividend of five cents per Class A common stock payable Nov. 6 to stock of record Oct. 16 . 
The dividend represents the balance of its regular quarterly payout of 10 cents a share , of which half *T* was paid * July 17 in a final distribution prior to its merger with <unk> Real Estate Investment Corp. , also in July . 
The company said 0 it hopes * to resume its schedule of regular quarterly dividends at the end of this year . 
<unk> said 0 it notified Central Maine Power Co. 0 it will cancel a $ 4 billion *U* contract * to supply electricity to the Maine utility . 
The <unk> owned utility said 0 it is <unk> up the deal because `` the contract 's objectives <unk> n't be <unk> * . '' 
<unk> said 0 Maine regulators ' refusal * to approve the contract earlier this year halted work on transmission lines and stopped negotiations for <unk> of electricity carried * through Maine to other utilities . 
`` It would now be <unk> impossible * to begin deliveries in 1992 , '' a <unk> official said *T* . 
The contract was * to run from 1992 to <unk> . 
Under the contract <unk> was * to supply 400 <unk> of power to Central Maine Power * starting in 1992 , 600 <unk> * starting in 1995 and 900 <unk> * starting in 
<unk> said 0 Maine regulators ' refusal * to approve the contract means 0 Central Maine Power has lost its place in line . 
`` We <unk> n't sign any new contracts -LCB- with deliveries -RCB- beginning earlier than 2000 , '' the <unk> official said *T* . 
He said 0 <unk> already has some `` customers <unk> in mind '' for the power that *T* was * to be delivered * to Maine . 
`` Nothing <unk> has happened since we signed the contract * to undermine our conviction that <unk> was the <unk> , most <unk> acceptable choice for * meeting a part of our customers ' energy needs through the year <unk> , '' said *T* Central Maine senior vice president Donald F. Kelly . 
Central Maine said 0 it is evaluating `` many energy options '' 0 * to make up for the lost future power *T* , including new energy generation and management proposals from New England , and possibly new Canadian purchases . 
<unk> - Options traders <unk> were among the big victims of Friday 's plunging stock market , including one small firm that *T* required an emergency $ 50 million *U* bailout . 
While Monday 's <unk> markets helped other investors recoup losses , many options customers and professional traders in stock-index options and the options on takeover stocks were left * with <unk> losses , traders here and in New York said 0 *T* . 
Options traders were hurt * worse than others on Friday because of the highly volatile nature of options , which often *T* rise or fall in value several times the amount of the price change in the individual stock or index of stocks on which they are based * *T* . 
Thus , options traders Friday were stuck * with losses that also *T* were several times larger than those suffered * by many stock traders in New York . 
Jeffrey Miller of Miller <unk> Hirsch & Co. said that given the high degree of leverage in the options market , it <unk> is `` very easy for these guys to get wiped out * . 
That may just be the nature of these highly leveraged little <unk> . '' 
An options contract gives the holder the right * to buy -LRB- call -RRB- or sell -LRB- put -RRB- a specific amount of stock , or in this case the value of a stock index , based * on a <unk> price within a given time period . 
Options traders who *T* , in return for a small fee , or premium , had previously sold put options on stocks or stock indexes were forced on Friday * to buy those contracts back at the previously agreed prices , which *T* were substantially above those in the market as it was falling . 
They then had no choice in many cases but * to sell the contracts at prevailing prices -- in most cases at a substantial loss . 
The latest round of losses is likely * to be a serious blow to the Chicago Board Options Exchange , which *T* has never fully recovered from the <unk> of Black Monday , when investors fled the market because of huge losses *T* . 
<unk> matters worse was *T* the fact that late Friday afternoon the CBOE halted stock-index options trading in step with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange 's halt in stock-index futures . 
But while the Merc <unk> a half hour later , the CBOE remained closed , * leaving many options traders unable * to make trades that *T* might have reduced the losses . 
CBOE Chairman <unk> `` Duke '' Chapman , said that , unlike the futures market , the options exchange has * to open in a <unk> that *T* allows each different options series to trade . 
Exchange officials <unk> that they would n't have been able * to make such a <unk> with the time remaining Friday afternoon , and with the stock-index futures on the <unk> of * closing for a second and final time , the CBOE <unk> that its best course was * to remain closed . 
The damage was so bad <unk> at <unk> Corp. , an options trading firm here , that it was forced * to transfer its accounts to First Options of Chicago , a unit of Continental Bank Corp. , as a result of options trading losses . 
<unk> so far is the only member of a financial exchange 0 *T* to be forced * to be taken * over by another firm as a result of Friday 's <unk> . 
<unk> still had several million dollars in capital left * after Friday 's close of trading , but not enough that regulators , worried * about another potential market plunge yesterday , would let it reopen for trading , options exchange officials said 0 *T* . 
Thus , in an unprecedented arrangement <unk> the <unk> of the transfer , the CBOE , the American Stock Exchange and the Options <unk> Corp. , as well as the firm 's owner , Stephen <unk> , put up a total of $ 50 million *U* * to guarantee the customer positions being transferred * to the bank holding company subsidiary in case the market plunged again yesterday . 
S. <unk> <unk> III , vice chairman of Continental Bank , First Options ' parent company , said 0 the firm took on about 160 accounts formerly held * by <unk> , almost all of them <unk> to professional floor traders . 
`` Steve and his firm were still worth a lot of money , '' Mr. <unk> said *T* . 
`` A package of credit support <unk> was put * together -- including the assets of Steve and his firm . '' 
The bailout was <unk> * together over the weekend , with officials from the Federal Reserve Board , Securities and Exchange Commission , Comptroller of the Currency and Treasury as well as the options exchanges . 
`` It <unk> was great * to have the luxury of time , '' Mr. <unk> said *T* . 
At one point , an options industry official had * to talk the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago 's night <unk> into * giving him the home phone number of <unk> <unk> , Chicago Fed president . 
First Options did n't have * to put any money into the bailout . 
Yesterday 's rally in the stock , futures and options markets led CBOE and Amex officials to conclude that the $ 50 million *U* in guarantees almost certainly <unk> n't need * to be tapped * by First Options . 
The <unk> firm had some losses and liquidity problems during the October 1987 crash as well , Mr. <unk> said 0 *T* . 
A federal official said that Continental Bank worked with securities and banking regulators over the weekend * to fashion the <unk> bailout , but that conditions were n't <unk> * by those agencies . 
`` It was their business decision , '' the official said *T* . 
Officials at Options <unk> Corp. , which *T* processes all options trades for U.S. exchanges , said that the $ 50 million *U* guarantee was unprecedented , but was necessary * to help * <unk> the integrity of the options markets . 
`` It was an extraordinary situation that *T* needed extraordinary steps , '' said *T* Paul Stevens , <unk> president and chief operating officer . 
Mr. Stevens declined * to give the specific contributions to the $ 50 million *U* guarantee from each participant . 
But CBOE and Amex officials said that Options <unk> Corp. contributed $ 20 million *U* to the guarantee , the CBOE put up $ 8 million *U* , the Amex added $ 4 million *U* and $ 18 million *U* came from Mr. <unk> 's own assets . 
Mr. <unk> could n't be reached * * to comment .

`` It 's like an <unk> in this room , '' Ms. Foster <unk> *T* . 
The room in question is the directors ' <unk> of <unk> Heinz Co. , 60 floors above the <unk> of Pittsburgh .

`` On days that I 'm really busy *T* , '' says *T* Ms. Foster , who *T* works in public relations for the company , `` it <unk> seems <unk> * to take time off for a <unk> . '' 
Although such sessions may never replace coffee breaks , <unk> <unk> , as it is known * in the trade , is certainly <unk> corporate America . 
In some companies middle managers <unk> <unk> <unk> into the office , * <unk> that <unk> executives <unk> n't approve . 
Ms. Foster 's <unk> is nothing like the <unk> , <unk> <unk> enjoyed * by <unk> visitors . 
Nor does it at all <unk> -LRB- despite what some executives think *T* -RRB- the more <unk> variety offered * at specialty <unk> in bad parts of town . 
On the contrary , office <unk> usually take place in <unk> <unk> conference rooms , where <unk> employees <unk> in <unk> designed chairs , * fully <unk> . 
The <unk> last 15 minutes and typically cost about $ 10 *U* . 
Some companies , including Heinz , even pay part of the fee . 
Ms. <unk> has been seeing some 15 clients a visit since the program was started * at Heinz last year . 
Anthony <unk> <unk> , the company 's chairman , <unk> by her firm touch , * saying 0 regular <unk> are a <unk> for his old football injuries . 
<unk> advocates say that * <unk> the head , <unk> , neck and back can go a long way toward * easing tension and improving morale . 
They also insist that <unk> is a basic need , as powerful as the need for food or sleep , and that the office is as good a place as any 0 * to do it *T* . 
`` The blood flows to your head , you feel <unk> and you do n't feel tension around the head or neck , '' says *T* <unk> <unk> , an operations supervisor at the Social Security office in Grand <unk> , Mich. , where <unk> began last month *T* .

Adds <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> who *T* <unk> her trade in the Grand <unk> office , `` They fall in love with my hands . '' 
Not everyone , however , is at ease with office <unk> . 
Three years ago , the Internal Revenue Service 's office in San Jose , Calif. , opened its doors to <unk> <unk> . 
And even though employees paid the bill , taxpayers <unk> . 
`` Sometimes , with the release of stress , you hear <unk> <unk> ' and <unk> <unk> ' coming out of the room , '' explains *T* Morgan Banks , the agency 's health specialist . 
`` And you <unk> n't have taxpayers coming into an audit hearing <unk> <unk> ' and <unk> <unk> . ' '' 
Last month , the complaints intensified and the <unk> ended . 
`` Now we 're looking for a room with <unk> walls , '' Ms. Banks says *T* . 
<unk> also has an image problem 0 * to contend with *T* . 
Some <unk> have tried * to get around this by * calling themselves `` <unk> '' and describing their office visits as `` <unk> breaks . '' 
But <unk> , no matter how <unk> , is still associated * in many minds with <unk> <unk> for <unk> , and that makes some executives nervous . 
Last year , the research and development division of <unk> Co. , the large <unk> concern , invited a <unk> to its <unk> , Wash. , offices . 
Phil <unk> , a software engineer , was an eager customer . 
`` You build up a lot of tension * working at a terminal all day , '' he says *T* . 
But after about eight months , the vice president of the division , Ed <unk> , learned about the sessions and brought them to a halt . 
Mr. <unk> says 0 his only beef was that the <unk> were being given * in a company conference room ; the department 's <unk> health facility would have been fine . 
`` In my view , -LCB- <unk> -RCB- should be managed with an appropriate <unk> of <unk> and <unk> around , '' he says *T* . 
Given such attitudes , some corporate <unk> prefer * to go about their business quietly .

The <unk> father of <unk> <unk> is David Palmer , a <unk> San Francisco <unk> whose mission *T* is * to save the <unk> <unk> . 
* To help do this , Mr. Palmer developed a portable <unk> chair <unk> three years ago that he hopes 0 *T* will bring `` structured <unk> '' into mainstream America . 
`` The culture is not ready * to take off its clothes , lie down and be touched * for an hour for $ 45 *U* , '' he says *T* .

In what *T* is believed * to be the first cancellation of a loan to China since the June 4 <unk> in Beijing , an international bank syndicate has terminated a $ 55 million *U* credit for a Shanghai property project . 
The syndicate , led * by <unk> Asia Ltd. , agreed last November * to provide the loan to Asia Development Corp. , a U.S. property developer . 
But several weeks ago , in the wake of the Beijing <unk> , the loan was canceled * , according to bankers and executives close to the project . 
Asia Development and <unk> declined * to comment on the move . 
<unk> had doubts about the project even before June 4 , but the harsh crackdown , which *T* caused many businesses to <unk> their China transactions , `` gave the banks the out 0 they wanted *T* , '' says 0 *T* an official close to the Shanghai venture . 
The decision * to cancel the loan <unk> the tough attitude 0 bankers have taken *T* toward China since June 4 . 
While some commercial lending has resumed , international lenders remain nervous about China 's economic troubles and foreign debt -- $ 40 billion *U* at the end of 1988 . 
Many loans <unk> are being <unk> * , especially those tied * to the hotel sector , which *T* has been hit * hard by a <unk> 4 tourism slump . 
Many bankers view <unk> loans as particularly risky . 
The canceled Shanghai loan leaves Asia Development , a small concern , <unk> * with a <unk> <unk> apartment building and heavy debts . 
The company owes $ 11 million *U* to the <unk> On Group , the project 's Hong Kong contractor , and a significant , though unspecified , amount in legal fees to <unk> Brothers , a U.S. law firm , the sources say 0 *T* . 
The project , known * as Lotus <unk> , has been <unk> * in controversy . 
When the loan agreement was announced * *T* , it was hailed * as one of the first <unk> financing transactions ever used * in China . 
Unlike most loans to China , there was no Chinese <unk> . 
Instead , the banks secured a promise <unk> from state-owned Bank of Communications that it would lend Asia Development the entire $ 55 million *U* at maturity * to finance repayment of the original borrowing . 
The loan was * to have <unk> in just two to three years , as soon as construction was completed * . 
But in a letter sent * in August to Asia Development , <unk> said 0 the loan was terminated * because the developer had failed * to deliver adequate financial data and pay certain fees to the <unk> committee on time , according to officials close to the project . 
<unk> involved in the project contend , however , that the termination actually had nothing 0 *T* to do with these technical violations . 
Instead , the creditors say 0 *T* , the loan fell victim to nervousness about China 's political turmoil , as well as to concern about the loan 's security . 
The bank syndicate is made * up mostly of European banks , but it includes China 's state-owned <unk> Industrial Bank . 
The 11 banks in the syndicate sustained no monetary losses because none of the credit facility had been drawn * down . 
K mart Corp. agreed * to acquire Pace <unk> <unk> Inc. for $ 23 *U* a share , or $ <unk> million *U* , in a move * to expand its presence in the rapidly growing <unk> business . 
The proposed merger comes as K mart 's profit is declining and sales at its core discount stores are rising more slowly than at such competitors as Wal-Mart Stores <unk> . 
K mart , based * in Troy , Mich. , recently said 0 net income would fall for the third consecutive quarter , after a 16 % drop in the first half of its current fiscal year . 
`` The membership <unk> concept has great potential , '' the company 's chairman , Joseph E. <unk> , said *T* in a statement .

K mart tested the <unk> sector last year with its acquisition of a 51 % interest in <unk> <unk> . 
But the <unk> chain , which *T* operates as a joint venture between K mart and <unk> Holdings N.V. of the Netherlands , has only six stores and annual sales that one analyst estimated *T* at about $ 300 million *U* . 
<unk> Pace , based * in <unk> , Colo. , operates 41 <unk> stores . 
The company had losses for several years before * turning profitable in fiscal 1988 . 
In the year ended Jan. 31 , Pace <unk> up profit of $ 9.4 million *U* , or 72 cents a share , after a tax-loss <unk> , on sales of $ 1.3 billion *U* , and analysts expect its results to continue * to improve . 
`` The company turned the corner <unk> fairly recently in profitability , '' said *T* <unk> <unk> of PaineWebber Inc. , who *T* had been forecasting a 46 % jump in Pace 's net income from operations this year and another 42 % increase next year . 
`` <unk> productivity is really beginning * to take off . '' 
But some analysts contend 0 K mart has agreed * to pay too much for Pace . 
`` Even if you look at it as a turnaround situation , it 's expensive , '' said *T* Wayne <unk> of Prudential-Bache Securities <unk> . 
`` In my opinion , you would only pay that kind of price if you were getting a premier player in the industry . '' 
Ms. <unk> of PaineWebber raised a more fundamental question about the deal . 
`` If K mart <unk> n't get its act together in discounting , why is it spending time 0 * worrying about other growing markets *T* ? '' 
She said , `` I would say 0 K mart 's number one job is * to address its <unk> loss -LCB- in discount stores -RCB- , which longer-term *T* will lead to improved profit margins . 
At that point , perhaps diversification would be appropriate . '' 
But K mart 's Mr. <unk> is intent on * pushing the company into new retail businesses . 
For instance , K mart is opening big food and general merchandise stores , called * <unk> , and <unk> stores specializing in office products and sporting goods . 
It also operates <unk> , Pay Less Drug Stores and <unk> Square home improvement stores . 
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , K mart closed yesterday at $ 36 *U* a share , up 12.5 cents . 
Pace rose $ <unk> *U* * to close at $ <unk> *U* a share in national over-the-counter trading . 
A K mart spokesman said 0 the acquisition would be financed * with short-term borrowings . 
Under terms of the agreement , a K mart subsidiary will soon make a tender offer for Pace shares . 
Among the conditions of the offer is *T* that Pace shareholders tender a majority of the company 's shares outstanding . 
The companies said 0 Pace would ill continue * to operate under its present management . 
G. William Ryan , president of <unk> <unk> , was named * chief executive officer of the unit of this media company , effective Jan. 1 . 
He will succeed Joel <unk> , who *T* will remain a vice president of the company and continue * to represent <unk> stations in several industry organizations , the company said 0 *T* . 
literally . 
Traders <unk> watching their <unk> <unk> machines yesterday morning were stunned * to see the Dow Jones Industrial Average <unk> 99 points in seconds . 
A minute later it soared <unk> points , then <unk> back down <unk> points , 69 below Friday 's close . 
`` It was crazy , '' said *T* Neil <unk> , general partner of <unk> Capital <unk> . 
`` It was like * flying without a pilot in the front of the plane . '' 
But those who *T* said `` This <unk> n't be happening '' were right . 
The <unk> were wrong . 
<unk> Systems Inc. , a Citicorp unit , blamed the <unk> <unk> on `` a timing problem in our software '' caused * by the enormous early volume -- about 145 million shares in the first hour of New York Stock Exchange trading . 
The prices of the individual stocks that *T* make up the average were correct , <unk> said 0 *T* , but the average was wrong . 
Meanwhile , there was an awful lot of confusion . 
At about <unk> a.m. on the over-the-counter trading desk at a major brokerage firm , a veteran trader who *T* buys and sells some of the most active stocks looked at a senior official and asked , `` What 's *T* going on ? 
Is the market up or down ? '' 
At the time , <unk> was reporting that the industrial average was down 70 points . 
In fact , it was up 24 . 
Holly Stark , a vice president who *T* heads the trading desk at Dillon Read Capital Corp. , said that once she figured out 0 the <unk> numbers were wrong , she called brokers * to tell them . 
`` It 's been kind of <unk> , * to say the least , '' she said *T* . 
* To <unk> matters further , when UAL Corp. stock finally opened on the New York Stock Exchange at <unk> a.m. *T* , the price was listed * at $ <unk> *U* a share , up about $ 45 *U* from Friday ; in fact , its true price was $ <unk> *U* , down $ 55 *U* . 
That was the New York Stock Exchange 's <unk> . 
A spokesman cited a `` technical error '' and declined * to elaborate . 
And there were other <unk> . 
When the market opened at <unk> a.m. EST *T* , a reporter for the Reuters <unk> <unk> the industrial average 's drop as a 4 % decline when it really was down 0.7 % *T* . 
`` It was a case of human error , which we found *T* almost immediately and corrected *T* , '' a spokesman for <unk> in New York said *T* . 
Meanwhile , some currency traders at West German banks in Frankfurt said 0 they sold dollars on the news and had * to buy them back later at higher prices . 
But it was the <unk> problems that *T* had <unk> effects . 
Dillon Read 's Ms. Stark said in early afternoon that she was still <unk> prices and other data as subject to verification , and she said 0 portfolio managers continued * to question the numbers 0 they saw *T* on the screen . 
It was the second time <unk> in less than a week that <unk> has had problems * <unk> the industrial average *T* . 
At the start of trading last Wednesday , the average appeared * to plunge more than 200 points . 
Actually , it was down only a few points at the time . 
<unk> said 0 that <unk> , which *T* lasted nine minutes , resulted from a failure * to adjust for a <unk> stock split at Philip Morris <unk> . 
A <unk> spokeswoman said 0 recent software changes may have contributed to yesterday 's problems . 
She said 0 <unk> switched to a <unk> system until the problems were corrected * . 
`` Today of all days , '' she <unk> *T* . 
`` The eyes of the world were watching us . 
Steven F. <unk> was named * a senior vice president of this graphics equipment company . 
He retains his current positions as chief strategic officer of AM International and president of AM Ventures . 
Houston attorney Dale <unk> , representing a plaintiff in a damage suit , says 0 he has negotiated a settlement that *T* will strike a blow for his client . 
<unk> . 
It turns out 0 Mr. <unk> 's client , <unk> <unk> of Cincinnati , did n't like the way 0 defense attorney Tom Alexander acted during the legal proceedings *T* . 
So she has agreed * to <unk> monetary damages against Mr. Alexander 's client in return for the right * to <unk> the attorney . 
Ms. <unk> 's mother also gets * to <unk> Mr. Alexander . 
So does *T* Mr. <unk> and his law partner , <unk> Nichols . 
The bizarre arrangement grows out of Mr. Alexander 's representation of <unk> Construction Co. , one of several defendants in a <unk> death lawsuit brought * by Ms. <unk> , the <unk> of a construction worker killed * in January 1987 while * working on a new Houston convention center . 
Last month , Mr. <unk> says 0 *T* , Mr. Alexander 's associate agreed that <unk> would pay $ 50,000 *U* as part of an overall settlement . 
But Mr. Alexander <unk> the deal at the last minute , * <unk> the plaintiff 's side . 
`` I never agreed to it , '' Mr. Alexander says *T* , * adding that `` it <unk> 's not necessary * to pay these <unk> settlements . '' 
When Ms. <unk> and her mother heard about what *T* had happened *T* , Mr. <unk> says 0 *T* , they <unk> that they would like * to give Mr. Alexander a good <unk> . 
Mr. <unk> says 0 he passed that along to his <unk> , and soon they were talking about the ground rules under which <unk> could keep its money *T* and the plaintiffs could take a shot at Mr. Alexander *T* . 
Although time and place have yet * to be determined * , some details are in place . 
Mr. <unk> says 0 he agreed * to strike Mr. Alexander above the belt . 
Ms. <unk> and her mother indicated 0 they want * to `` catch him <unk> from behind , '' he says 0 *T* . 
Mr. Alexander , for his part , insisted that the <unk> <unk> n't <unk> their <unk> rights to anyone else , <unk> n't use a blunt instrument and <unk> n't take a running start . 
Mr. Alexander says 0 he <unk> the agreement , which *T* has n't been submitted * to a judge , as something of a joke . 
However , he acknowledges 0 they `` have the option of * taking a <unk> at me if they really want to *?* . '' 
Mr. <unk> says 0 his side is `` dead serious . '' 
Although they do n't <unk> * delivering any <unk> <unk> , he says that Mr. Alexander will be asked * to sign a release from liability , just in case . 
After two years of drought , it <unk> money in the stock-index futures markets yesterday . 
As financial markets rebounded , trading volume in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange 's huge Standard & Poor 's 500 stock-index futures pit soared , * reaching <unk> levels for the first time since October 1987 . 
The sudden <unk> of liquidity enabled several traders to reap <unk> <unk> in a matter of minutes as prices soared , traders said *T* . 
`` <unk> were <unk> money in there today , '' said *T* John <unk> , a futures broker for Elders Futures Inc. in Chicago . 
The S&P 500 futures contract , which *T* moves in <unk> of an index point under normal conditions , jumped two to three points in seconds early yesterday after an initial downturn , then moved strongly higher the rest of the day . 
Each index point represents a $ 500 *U* profit for each S&P 500 contract held * . 
For the first time since the 1987 crash , traders said that they were able * to trade several hundred S&P 500 contracts at a time in a highly liquid market . 
Many institutions and individual investors have <unk> away from stock-index futures , * <unk> them for * <unk> the stock market crash on Black Monday two years ago . 
Since the crash , many futures traders have n't assumed large positions for fear that the S&P 500 market , with much of its customer order flow missing , would dry up if prices turned against them . 
More than 400 traders <unk> the S&P 500 futures pit * to <unk> the opening <unk> . 
Traders were <unk> bids and offers a full five minutes before the start of trading at <unk> am 
The contract fell five points <unk> at the open to <unk> , the maximum opening move allowed * under <unk> adopted * by the Merc * to stem a market slide . 
But several traders quickly stepped up and bid for contracts , * driving prices sharply higher . 
The market <unk> near Friday 's closing price of <unk> for about a half hour , * moving several index points higher or lower in seconds , then broke higher and did n't look back . 
The S&P 500 contract that *T* expires in December closed up a record <unk> points on volume of nearly 80,000 contracts . 
`` Traders five feet from each other were making bids and offers that *T* were a full point apart , '' said *T* one S&P 500 broker . 
`` You could buy at the bid and sell at the offer and make a fortune , '' he <unk> *T* . 
Several of Wall Street 's largest securities firms , including Salomon Brothers Inc. and PaineWebber Inc. , were also large buyers , traders said 0 *T* . 
Salomon Brothers was among the largest sellers of stock-index futures last week , traders said 0 *T* . 
<unk> firms as a rule do n't comment on their market activity . 
Unlike the week following Black Monday two years ago , individual traders in the S&P 500 pit were also being <unk> <unk> about their one-day profits . 
`` With the FBI around here , <unk> rights are a thing of the past , '' said *T* one trader , * referring to the federal investigation of futures trading that so far *T* has resulted in 46 indictments <unk> * against individuals on the Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade . 
The market for $ 200 billion *U* of high-yield junk bonds <unk> some of its <unk> as the Dow Jones Industrial Average rebounded from Friday 's plunge . 
But the junk recovery , led * by the <unk> RJR Holdings bonds , was <unk> . 
No trading <unk> existed for the vast majority of junk bonds , securities industry officials said 0 *T* . 
On Friday , trading in practically every issue ground to a halt as potential buyers fled and brokerage firms were unwilling * to provide bid and offer prices for most issues . 
`` Nothing traded on Friday , and people were n't really sure where the market should have opened '' yesterday *T* , said 0 *T* Raymond <unk> , <unk> of merchant banking at Merrill Lynch & <unk> . 
`` But we had a fairly active day yesterday . '' 
At Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , the leading underwriter of junk bonds , `` I was prepared * to be in a very bad mood tonight , '' said 0 *T* David <unk> , a junk bond trader . 
`` Now , I feel 0 maybe there 's a little bit of <unk> . '' 
But before the stock market rebounded from a sharp early sell-off yesterday , he said 0 *T* , `` You could n't buy -LCB- junk bonds -RCB- and you could n't give them away . '' 
Yesterday 's rally was led * by RJR Holdings 13 <unk> % bonds , which initially *T* tumbled three points , or $ 30 *U* for each $ 1,000 *U* face amount , to 96 <unk> before * <unk> to 99 <unk> . 
Bonds issued * by Kroger , <unk> , Safeway and American Standard also showed big gains , * recovering almost all their losses from Friday and early yesterday . 
But traders said 0 the junk bond market increasingly is <unk> into a <unk> group , in which trades can be executed * easily *T* , and a larger group of <unk> bonds in which liquidity -- or the ability * to trade without too much difficulty -- has steadily <unk> this year *T* . 
`` <unk> has n't returned to the vast middle ground of the market , '' said *T* Mr. <unk> of Merrill . 
`` The <unk> are still <unk> , '' said *T* Mr. <unk> of Drexel . 
Analysts are concerned that much of the high-yield market will remain <unk> for investors . 
Paul <unk> , associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 's <unk> School of Management , * citing a pattern of junk-bond default rates that *T* are low in the early years after issuance and rise later , says , `` We 're now in a period where we 're starting * to see <unk> from the big issue years of 1984 to 1986 . '' 
Mark <unk> , a senior vice president at Standard & Poor 's Corp. , confirms that there is `` increasing concern about the future liquidity of the junk bond market . '' 
`` <unk> bonds are a highly <unk> market , '' said *T* Lewis <unk> , vice chairman of Smith Barney , Harris Upham & <unk> . 
`` There 's a whole bunch of stuff that *T* 's money good and a whole bunch of stuff that *T* 's not so good . '' 
Analysts at Standard & Poor 's say 0 junk bond offerings by `` tightly <unk> '' issuers seem * to be growing . 
Almost $ 8 billion *U* of junk bonds that *T* are considered * <unk> include issues from <unk> TV , Gillette Holdings -LRB- not related to Gillette Co. -RRB- , Interco , <unk> <unk> , Allied Stores , Federated Department Stores , National <unk> , <unk> Holdings , <unk> , <unk> Transportation and Price Communications . 
`` You could still have some very bad times ahead , '' said *T* Mr. <unk> . 
`` It <unk> 's possible * to have a 10 % default rate in one year , because we 're already seeing big problems in the midst of a pretty strong economy . 
I 'm certainly not comfortable * saying 0 we 've seen the bottom . '' 
But yesterday 's rally among `` good '' junk was a badly needed <unk> for the market . 
Many issues `` bounced off the floor , '' Mr. <unk> said 0 *T* , and benchmark junk issues `` recovered all of their losses '' from Friday and early yesterday . 
In contrast , he says 0 *T* , `` The stock market gained back only about half what it lost *T* Friday , and the -LCB- government -RCB- bond market lost about half what it gained *T* Friday . '' 
Traders said 0 yesterday 's rally was fueled * by insurance companies looking for bargains after a drastic slide in prices the past month . 
In addition , mutual funds did n't appear * to be major sellers of high-yield securities as * was expected * . 
`` Sometimes a <unk> is healthy , '' said *T* Drexel 's Mr. <unk> . 
`` People will learn * to be more <unk> . 
If they do good credit analysis , they will avoid the hand <unk> . 
I think 0 the market is in good shape . 
Should you really own stocks ? 
That 's a question 0 a lot of people are asking *T* , following the stock market 's stunning display of volatility . 
* <unk> financially and <unk> by Friday 's <unk> <unk> drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and yesterday 's <unk> rebound , they 're wondering if an individual has any business * being in the market . 
The answer , say 0 *T* academic researchers , money managers and investment specialists , is yes -- as long as you approach the stock market as an investor . 
But , they say 0 *T* , people should n't try * to be traders , who *T* buy and sell in an effort * to ride the latest economic trend or catch the next hot stock . 
The case for * owning stocks over the long-term is compelling . 
`` If you look at 75 years worth of investment history -- including the Great Depression and every bear market since -- stocks have <unk> almost everything 0 an individual could have owned *T* by a long shot , '' says *T* Barry Berlin , vice president at First <unk> Capital Management . 
A dollar invested * in the stock market in <unk> would have grown to $ <unk> *U* by the end of last June , according to Laurence Siegel , managing director at <unk> Associates <unk> . 
But a dollar invested * in long-term bonds in <unk> would have grown to only $ <unk> *U* , and a dollar put * in Treasury bills would equal a <unk> $ <unk> *U* . 
The longer the time period , the less risk 0 there is *T* of * losing money in the stock market . 
Over time , the odds increasingly favor the investor with a diversified portfolio . 
For instance , Ken Gregory , a San Francisco money manager , <unk> that if an investor holds a basket of stocks that *T* tracks the Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index , the chance of * losing money is 3 % to 4 % *U* over a 10-year period , compared with 15 % over three years and 30 % over one year . 
`` If you do n't need the money for 10 years , there 's a <unk> case for * sticking to a steady core of stocks , '' Mr. Gregory says *T* . 
<unk> investments also help * balance the other assets 0 an individual owns *T* , says 0 *T* John <unk> Jr. , president of the Institute of <unk> Financial <unk> . 
Stocks have a place in an investors ' portfolio along with real estate , bonds , international securities and cash , he says 0 *T* . 
There are some important <unk> : Before * investing in stocks , individuals should have at least three to six months of living expenses set * aside in the bank , most investment advisers say 0 *T* . 
<unk> also should focus on * building equity in a home , which *T* provides some protection against inflation , as well as a <unk> that *T* can be <unk> * in late in life * to help * cover the cost of retirement living . 
People also should n't invest money <unk> in stocks that they 'll need *T* in the near future -- for example , for college tuition payments or retirement expenses . 
`` You may have * to sell your stocks at a time when the market takes a plunge *T* , '' says *T* Mr. <unk> , a Del <unk> , Calif. financial planner . 
But once the <unk> are covered * , `` then I would start * to invest , even if it 's as little as $ 1,000 *U* , '' says 0 *T* Michael Lipper , president of Lipper Analytical Services <unk> . 
He says 0 individuals should consider not just stocks , but other long-term investments , such as high-quality bonds . 
Despite the strong case for stocks , however , most <unk> warn that individuals should n't try * to profit from short-term developments . 
`` It 's very difficult 0 * to do *T* , '' says *T* Donald <unk> , a market strategist for <unk> Morgan Securities , a Los Angeles brokerage firm . 
`` Our markets move so fast <unk> and they are so volatile <unk> , 0 there 's no way 0 the average investor can compete with the <unk> *T* . '' 
Individual investors face high transaction costs of * moving in and out of the market . 
The cost of * <unk> stock orders <unk> from brokerage to brokerage and with the size of the order , but 2 % of the order 's value is an average , says 0 *T* Stephen <unk> , manager of T. Rowe Price 's Growth and Income mutual fund . 
And * assuming 0 their first investment is successful , investors will have * to pay taxes on their gains . 
That can reduce returns by a third or more , once local taxes are included * , Mr. Lipper says 0 *T* . 
After that , individual traders face the risk that the new investment 0 they choose *T* <unk> n't perform well -- so their trading costs could be sustained * for nothing . 
`` It <unk> 's very tough for most individuals to <unk> the mutual funds or the market , '' says *T* Mr. Lipper . 
`` You should really think twice if you think 0 you can <unk> the system . '' 
Then , too , many individual investors lack the <unk> emotional <unk> 0 professionals say 0 *T* is needed * * to plunge in and out of the market . 
So what *T* 's the best way 0 * to buy stocks *T* ? 
`` Unless an individual has a minimum of between $ 50,000 and $ 100,000 *U* 0 *T* to invest in stocks , he 's still better off in mutual funds than in individual stocks , in terms of * getting enough attention from a <unk> broker , '' says *T* Mr. Lipper . 
Still , he adds 0 *T* , `` I could see * owning both , given that individuals often have an advantage over big investors in * <unk> special situations * based on their own <unk> , '' he adds *T* . 
George Douglas , first vice president at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , says that individuals have a particular edge now in `` small to <unk> niche companies with exciting earnings prospects '' -- a traditional <unk> ground for small investors . 
This growth sector , which usually *T* carries a <unk> multiple about twice that of the Standard & Poor 's 500 , happens * to include some of the market 's most attractive bargains right now . 
`` It 's now selling at a multiple about even with the market , '' says *T* Mr. Douglas . 
Moreover , Mr. Douglas sees a revival of institutional interest in smaller growth stocks that *T* could boost the performance of these stocks in the medium term . 
Many big Wall Street brokerage firms who *T* eliminated their research effort in stocks of emerging growth companies a few years ago are now <unk> coverage of this area , he notes 0 *T* . 
`` We 're seeing a real turnaround in interest in small growth stocks , '' he says *T* . 
The <unk> <unk> advise individuals * to stay away from the latest investment <unk> . 
They say 0 that 's especially important this late in the growth phase of the economic cycle , when there 's no robust bull market * to bail investors out of their mistakes *T* . 
Friday 's correction presents `` a pretty good buying opportunity , but * let 's not speculate at this point in the business cycle , '' says 0 *T* <unk> <unk> , chief equity portfolio strategist at First Boston <unk> . 
`` * <unk> stocks on weakness for their long-term fundamentals , '' he says *T* . 
In the long run , investment advisers say 0 *T* , most investors will be better off * using the <unk> averaging method of * buying stocks . 
In this method , a person invests a regular amount every month or quarter into the stock market whether the market is up or down . 
That cuts the risk , Mr. Gregory , the San Francisco money manager , points out *T* . 
`` When the market is low *T* , you are buying more shares , and when it 's high *T* , you 're buying fewer shares , '' he says *T* . 
Otherwise , if you put all your money in at one time , by sheer bad luck , you might pick a terrible time , and have * to wait three years * to get even , Mr. Gregory says 0 *T* . 
A <unk> program will work the best , Mr. <unk> says 0 *T* . 
`` One of the hardest things 0 * to do *T* is * to buy stocks when the market is down *T* , '' he says *T* . 
`` But that 's just the time when you should be buying them *T* . ''

Donald Trump , who *T* faced rising doubt about his bid for American Airlines parent AMR Corp. even before a United Airlines buy-out came apart Friday , withdrew his $ <unk> billion *U* offer . 
Separately , bankers representing the group trying * to buy United 's parent UAL Corp. met with other banks about * <unk> that purchase at a lower price , possibly around $ 250 *U* a share , or $ <unk> billion *U* . 
But a lower bid could face rejection by the UAL board . 
Mr. Trump , who *T* vowed Wednesday * to `` go forward '' with the bid , said 0 he was dropping it `` in light of the recent change in market conditions . '' 
He said 0 he might now sell his AMR stake , buy more shares , or make another offer at a lower price . 
The Manhattan real-estate developer acted after the UAL buyers failed * to obtain financing for their earlier $ <unk> *U* bid , which *T* sparked a selling panic among that *T* <unk> into a <unk> drop Friday in the Dow Jones Industrial Average . 
News about UAL and AMR , whose shares *T* never <unk> after trading was halted * Friday for the UAL announcement , sent both stocks <unk> in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange . 
UAL tumbled $ <unk> *U* to $ <unk> *U* on volume of 2.3 million shares , and AMR declined by $ <unk> *U* to $ <unk> *U* as 4.7 million shares changed hands . 
* Together , the two stocks <unk> <unk> among takeover stock traders , and caused a 7.3 % drop in the Dow Jones Transportation Average , second in size only to the stock-market crash of Oct. 19 , 1987 . 
Some said 0 Friday 's market debacle had given Mr. Trump an excuse * to bail out of an offer that *T* showed signs of <unk> even before problems <unk> emerged with the UAL deal . 
After * reaching an intraday high of $ <unk> *U* the day 0 Mr. Trump disclosed his bid *T* Oct. 5 , AMR 's stock had retreated as low as $ <unk> *U* last week . 
Some takeover stock traders had been betting against Mr. Trump because he has a record of * disclosing stakes in companies that *T* are potential takeover targets , then * selling at a profit without * making a bid . 
`` He still has n't proven his <unk> as a <unk> <unk> artist , '' said *T* airline analyst Kevin Murphy of Morgan Stanley & <unk> . 
`` He 's done this thing where he 'll buy a little bit of a company and then trade out of it *T* . 
He 's written this book , <unk> The Art of the <unk> . ' 
Why does n't he just follow through on one of these things *T* ? '' 
Mr. Trump withdrew his bid before the AMR board , which *T* is due * to meet tomorrow , ever formally considered it . 
AMR had <unk> a wide range of possible responses , from flat rejection to <unk> and leveraged buy-outs that *T* might have included either employees , a <unk> buyer such as Texas <unk> Robert Bass , or both . 
AMR had also sought * to <unk> Mr. Trump in Congress by * lobbying for legislation that *T* would have bolstered the authority <unk> of the Transportation Department * to reject airline buy-outs . 
Yesterday , Mr. Trump tried * to put the blame for the collapse of the UAL deal on Congress , * saying 0 it was rushing through a bill * to protect AMR executives . 
`` I believe that the perception that legislation in this area may be <unk> approved * contributed to the collapse of the UAL transaction , and the resulting <unk> in the financial markets experienced * this past Friday , '' Mr. Trump wrote members of Congress *T* . 
AMR declined * to comment , and Mr. Trump did n't respond to requests for interviews . 
Mr. Trump never said how much AMR stock he had bought *T* , only that his holdings were `` substantial . '' 
However , he only received federal clearance * to buy more than $ 15 million *U* of the stock on Sept. 20 , when the price rose $ 2 *U* a share to $ <unk> *U* *T* . 
Between then and his bid on Oct. 5 , the price <unk> between $ <unk> *U* and $ <unk> *U* . 
In an attempt * to persuade investors that his bid was n't just `` a stock play , '' Mr. Trump promised last week * to notify the market before * selling any shares . 
AMR was trading at around $ 84 *U* yesterday before his withdrawal announcement , then immediately fell to about $ 76 *U* . 
* <unk> that he paid a rough average price of $ 80 *U* a share , and assuming 0 he did n't sell before his announcement reached the market , Mr. Trump could be sitting with a modest loss with the stock at $ <unk> *U* . 
Some analysts said 0 AMR Chairman Robert <unk> might seize the opportunity presented * by the stock price drop * to protect the nation 's largest airline with a defensive transaction , such as the sale of stock to a friendly holder or company employees . 
However , other <unk> observers said 0 they believed 0 Mr. <unk> and the AMR board might well decide * to tough it out without * taking any extra steps . 
Some analysts said 0 they believed 0 Mr. Trump , whose <unk> <unk> *T* had been viewed * by some as a reason * to believe 0 he would n't back out , might come back with a lower bid . 
Ray <unk> of Dillon Read & Co. said 0 Mr. Trump `` is stepping back and waiting for the dust to settle . 
I 'm sure 0 he still wants AMR . '' 
But others remained skeptical . 
`` I was never sure 0 Donald Trump really wanted * to take AMR , '' said *T* John <unk> , a bond analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton <unk> . 
`` What *T* happened with United was a <unk> way for him to <unk> out . '' 
Mr. Trump never obtained financing for his bid . 
That skepticism would leave him with an even greater credibility problem <unk> should he return that *T* would <unk> him in any effort * to oust the board in a proxy fight . 
Meanwhile , Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp. , the two lead lenders on the UAL buy-out , met with other banks yesterday * to determine if they would be willing * to finance the buy-out at a lower price . 
Officials familiar with the talks said 0 Citicorp had discussed * lowering the offer to $ 250 *U* a share , but said 0 that price was a talking point and that no decision has been made * . 
At $ 250 *U* a share , the group would have * to borrow about $ 6.1 billion *U* from banks . 
The first UAL deal <unk> after Citibank and Chase could n't raise $ 7.2 billion *U* . 
Citibank and Chase had agreed * to commit $ 3 billion *U* , and said 0 they were `` highly confident '' of * raising another $ 4.2 billion *U* . 
* Together , Citicorp and Chase received $ 8 million *U* in fees * to raise the rest of the financing . 
But other banks balked at the low interest rate and banking fees 0 the UAL group was willing * to pay them *T* . 
Officials familiar with the bank talks said 0 the UAL buy-out group -- UAL pilots , management , and British Airways PLC -- is now willing * to pay higher bank fees and interest , but is n't likely * to boost its $ <unk> million *U* equity contribution . 
Nor is the group likely * to come forward with a revised offer within the next 48 hours despite the hopes of many traders . 
The group 's advisers want * to make certain 0 they have firm bank commitments the second time around . 
Even if the buy-out group is able * to obtain financing , the transaction still faces obstacles . 
UAL 's board could reject the new price as too low , especially since there are n't any competing bids . 
Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis , whose $ <unk> *U* offer *T* was rejected * by UAL 's board , has n't shown signs of * pursuing a $ <unk> *U* <unk> bid 0 he made *T* last month . 
In addition , the coalition of labor and management , longtime enemies who *T* joined forces only under the threat of Mr. Davis 's bid , could break apart now . 
The group 's <unk> gets its first test today when 30 top pilot union leaders <unk> outside Chicago in a previously scheduled meeting *T* . 
Union Chairman <unk> . -LRB- <unk> -RRB- <unk> faces the tough task of * explaining why banks refused * to finance a buy-out 0 the members approved *T* overwhelmingly last week *T* . 
The pilot union is <unk> * to pursue an acquisition whatever the board decides *T* . 
But if the board <unk> a reduced bid and decides * to explore other alternatives , it could <unk> what *T* has been a <unk> process into an <unk> one . 
The pilots could play <unk> by * noting 0 they are crucial to any sale or restructuring because they can refuse * to fly the airplanes . 
If they were * to insist on a low bid of , * say $ 200 *U* a share , the board might n't be able * to obtain a higher offer from other bidders because banks might <unk> * to finance a transaction 0 the pilots oppose *T* . 
Also , because UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf and other UAL executives have joined the pilots ' bid , the board might be forced * to exclude him from its deliberations in order * to be fair to other bidders . 
That could cost him the chance * to influence the outcome and perhaps join the winning bidder . 
<unk> members of the House Ways and Means Committee introduced legislation that *T* would restrict how the new <unk> bailout agency can raise capital *T* , * creating another potential obstacle to the government 's sale of sick thrifts . 
The bill , whose backers *T* include Chairman Dan Rostenkowski -LRB- D. , Ill. -RRB- , would prevent the <unk> Trust Corp. from * raising temporary working capital by * having an <unk> bank or thrift issue debt that *T* would n't be counted * on the federal budget . 
The bill intends * to restrict the <unk> to Treasury borrowings only , unless the agency receives specific congressional authorization . 
`` Such agency <unk> <unk> ' borrowing is unauthorized and expensive , far more expensive than direct Treasury borrowing , '' said *T* Rep. <unk> Stark -LRB- D. , Calif. -RRB- , the bill 's chief sponsor . 
The complex financing plan in the S&L bailout law includes * raising $ 30 billion *U* from debt issued * by the newly created <unk> . 
This financing system was created * in the new law in order * to keep the bailout spending from * <unk> the budget deficit . 
Another $ 20 billion *U* would be raised * through Treasury bonds , which *T* pay lower interest rates . 
But the <unk> also requires `` working '' capital 0 * to maintain *T* the bad assets of thrifts that *T* are sold * , until the assets can be sold * separately . 
That debt would be paid * off as the assets are sold * , * leaving the total spending for the bailout at $ 50 billion *U* , or $ <unk> billion *U* including interest over 10 years . 
`` It 's a problem that *T* clearly has * to be resolved * , '' said *T* David Cooke , executive director of the <unk> . 
The agency has already spent roughly $ 19 billion *U* * selling 34 insolvent S&Ls , and it is likely * to sell or merge 600 by the time 0 the bailout concludes *T* . 
<unk> other working capital , he said 0 *T* , the <unk> would be forced * to delay other thrift <unk> until cash could be raised * by * selling the bad assets . 
`` We would have * to wait until we have collected on those assets before we can move forward , '' he said *T* . 
The complicated language in the huge new law has <unk> the fight . 
The law does allow the <unk> to borrow from the Treasury up to $ 5 billion *U* at any time . 
Moreover , it says 0 the <unk> 's total obligations may not exceed $ 50 billion *U* , but that figure is derived * after * including notes and other debt , and <unk> from it the market value of the assets 0 the <unk> holds *T* . 
But Congress did n't anticipate or intend more public debt , say 0 *T* opponents of the <unk> 's <unk> plan , and Rep. Charles <unk> -LRB- D. , <unk> . -RRB- said 0 the <unk> <unk> Board has been <unk> in * not keeping Congress informed . 
`` That secrecy leads to a proposal like the one from Ways and Means , which *T* seems to me sort of <unk> , '' he said *T* . 
`` The <unk> is going * to have * to pay a price of prior <unk> on the Hill if they want that kind of flexibility . '' 
The Ways and Means Committee will hold a hearing on the bill next Tuesday . 
We 're about * to see if advertising works . 
<unk> on the heels of Friday 's <unk> stock-market plunge and the uncertainty that *T* 's followed , a few big brokerage firms are rolling out new ads <unk> a familiar message : * <unk> on * investing , the market 's just fine . 
Their mission is * to keep clients from * <unk> the market , as individual investors did in <unk> after the crash in October 
Just days after the 1987 crash , major brokerage firms rushed out ads * to calm investors . 
This time around , they 're moving even faster . 
PaineWebber Inc. <unk> a new television commercial at 4 p.m. EDT yesterday and had it on the air by last night . 
Fidelity Investments placed new ads in newspapers yesterday , and wrote another new ad appearing today . 
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. by yesterday afternoon had already written new TV ads . 
It considered * running them during tomorrow night 's World Series broadcast but decided * not to *?* when the market recovered yesterday *T* . 
Other brokerage firms , including Merrill Lynch & Co. , were <unk> out potential new ad strategies . 
The brokerage firms learned a lesson the last time around , when <unk> investors <unk> the phone lines and fled the market in a panic *T* . 
This time , the firms were ready . 
Fidelity , for example , prepared ads several months ago in case of a market plunge . 
When the market went into its free fall *T* Friday afternoon , the investment firm ordered full pages in the Monday <unk> of half a dozen newspapers . 
The ads touted Fidelity 's automated <unk> beneath the huge headline , `` Fidelity Is <unk> For Your <unk> . '' 
A Fidelity spokesman says 0 the <unk> , which *T* already was operating but which many clients did n't know about *T* , received about double the usual volume of calls over the weekend . 
`` A lot of investor confidence comes from the fact that they can speak to us , '' he says *T* . 
`` * To maintain that dialogue is absolutely crucial . 
It would have been too late 0 * to think about *T* on Friday . 
We had * to think about it ahead of time . '' 
Today 's Fidelity ad goes a step further , * encouraging investors to stay in the market or even to plunge in with Fidelity . 
<unk> the headline `` <unk> , '' it counsels , `` Based on the events of the past week , all investors need * to know 0 their portfolios are balanced * * to help * protect them against the market 's volatility . '' 
It goes on * to <unk> a few diversified Fidelity funds by name . 
PaineWebber also was able * to gear up quickly thanks to the 1987 crash . 
In the aftermath of the 1987 debacle , the brokerage firm began * <unk> commercials in-house , * ultimately getting its timing down fast enough * to tape a commercial after the market closed and rush it on the air that night . 
It also negotiated an arrangement with Cable News Network under which <unk> would agree * to air its last-minute <unk> *T* . 
The new PaineWebber commercial , created * with ad agency Saatchi & Saatchi Co. , features Mary <unk> , one of the firm 's most visible investment strategists , <unk> particularly bullish . 
* <unk> * just as the market closed yesterday , it offers Ms. <unk> advising , `` We view the market here as * going through a relatively normal cycle <unk> . 
We continue * to feel that the stock market is still the place 0 * to be *T* for long-term appreciation . '' 
The spot was scheduled * to appear three times on <unk> last night . 
PaineWebber considered an even harder sell , * recommending specific stocks . 
Instead , it settled on * just urging the clients who *T* are its <unk> * to keep that money in the market . 
`` We 're saying 0 the worst thing that anyone can do *T* is * to see the market go down and dump everything , which *T* just drives the prices down further , '' says *T* John <unk> , PaineWebber 's director of advertising . 
`` If you owned it and liked it Friday , the true value has n't changed . '' 
He adds , `` This is n't 1987 <unk> * . '' 
With the market <unk> and then closing up more than 88 points yesterday , investment firms had * to constantly revise their approach . 
At Shearson Lehman , executives created potential new commercials Friday night and throughout the weekend , then had * to <unk> yesterday afternoon . 
The plan had been * to make one of Shearson 's <unk> , <unk> `` Where We <unk> *T* '' commercials , which *T* have been running occasionally in response to news events since 1985 . 
The ad would have run during the World Series tomorrow , * replacing the debut commercial of Shearson 's new ad campaign , `` <unk> by <unk> . '' 
But in a meeting after the market closed yesterday , Shearson executives decided * not to go ahead with the stock-market ad . 
`` We do n't think at this point 0 anything needs * to be said * . 
The market seems * to be <unk> out ; we 're taking a <unk> attitude , '' says *T* <unk> B. Stewart , executive vice president of marketing . 
In any case , the brokerage firms are clearly moving faster <unk> * to create new ads than they did in the fall of 1987 . 
But it <unk> remains * to be seen * whether their ads will be any more effective . 
In 1987 , despite a <unk> of ads from most of the major investment firms , individuals ran from the market <unk> <unk> . 
Now the firms must try their hardest * to prove that advertising can work this time around . 
<unk> <unk> <unk> . 
<unk> <unk> : 
Edward <unk> , former chairman of <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , reached an agreement <unk> in principle * to acquire a majority stake in Arnold Advertising , a small Boston shop . 
Terms were n't disclosed * . 
Mr. <unk> , who *T* resigned his <unk> <unk> post in September , becomes chairman and chief executive of Arnold . 
John <unk> , the agency 's president and chief executive , will retain the title of president . 
Separately , McDonald 's Corp. , Oak <unk> , Ill. , named Arnold to handle its estimated $ 4 million *U* cooperative ad account for the Hartford , Conn. , area . 
That account had been handled * by <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> . 
<unk> <unk> : 
A <unk> ad supplement to Business Week 's special `` Corporate <unk> '' issue calls on business leaders * to use their clout * to help * solve the nation 's education crisis . 
The supplement , the largest ever for the magazine , includes ads from 52 corporate advertisers and <unk> off a two-year Business Week initiative on education . 
The magazine will distribute 10 % of the gross revenues from the supplement as grants to innovative teachers . 
You know what the law of averages is *T* , do n't you *?* ? 
It 's what 1 -RRB- *T* explains why we are like , well , ourselves rather than <unk> Jackson *T* ; 2 -RRB- *T* <unk> that it <unk> 's possible * to <unk> in a <unk> that *T* averages two feet deep ; and 3 -RRB- *T* predicts that 10,000 <unk> placed * before 10,000 <unk> would produce <unk> <unk> rock <unk> roll <unk> . 
<unk> , that game of the long <unk> , is the <unk> sport of the mean , and the mean <unk> law caught up with the San Francisco <unk> in the World Series last weekend . 
The team that *T* dumped runs by the bushel on the Chicago <unk> in the National League <unk> was held * to just one in two games by the <unk> Oakland A 's , the gang that *T* had been done <unk> * similarly by the Los Angeles <unk> and <unk> <unk> in last year 's <unk> . 
<unk> , much of the damage was accomplished * by A 's who *T* had some catching up 0 * to do *T* . 
In game two , on a cool Sunday evening in this land of <unk> autumn , a lot of the catching up was done * by the A 's <unk> , Terry <unk> . 
He hit a <unk> pitch from <unk> <unk> into the <unk> stands in <unk> four * to stretch his team 's lead from <unk> to a decisive <unk> , where it stayed *T* . 
So what if <unk> had struck just seven home runs in 130 <unk> games , and <unk> in the seventh position of the A 's <unk> . 
`` If you get your pitch , and take a good swing , anything can happen , '' he later <unk> *T* . 
On Saturday night , quite a few of the boys in green and gold <unk> away successes * to <unk> the pain of past and , no doubt , future <unk> . 
Mark <unk> , the big , <unk> Oakland first <unk> , had three hits <unk> in four at <unk> , two more than he 'd had *?* in the <unk> <unk> series in which he 'd gone <unk> *T* . 
The <unk> <unk> <unk> 6 through 9 , <unk> the `` bottom of the order , '' got seven of their team 's 11 hits and scored four of its runs in a <unk> decision . 
<unk> <unk> Stewart held the <unk> to five hits * to account for the zero on the other side of the Saturday <unk> . 
That he was the A 's <unk> <unk> during its American League campaign with a <unk> mark , plus two wins over Toronto in the <unk> , indicates 0 he may have some evening up coming , but with the way 0 his <unk> <unk> is <unk> *T* , that might not be this week . 
The same goes for Mike Moore , another veteran who *T* <unk> early <unk> * to permit the <unk> but a run and four hits in seven <unk> in Sunday 's contest . 
`` Every guy 0 they put *T* out there had a better <unk> than the guy before , '' <unk> *T* Giant manager Roger Craig . 
He 's an <unk> who *T* 's one of the leading <unk> of the <unk> delivery , which *T* looks like a <unk> until it <unk> beneath the <unk> <unk> . 
The <unk> of the <unk> is that the A 's go into San Francisco 's <unk> Park tonight up two games to none in the <unk> <unk> . 
The <unk> 0 * to <unk> with *T* here says that about three of four clubs -LRB- 29 of 39 -RRB- that *T* took <unk> Series leads went on * to win it all . 
That 's not an average 0 *T* to <unk> Giant <unk> . 
One might think that the home fans in this Series of the <unk> <unk> * <unk> -LRB- that 's a better name for a public <unk> than `` <unk> , '' do n't you think ? -RRB- would have been <unk> over the proceedings , but they <unk> them in relative calm . 
<unk> of the two <unk> sat side by side in the <unk> seats of Oakland <unk> , and while they <unk> their <unk> and <unk> the opposition , <unk> advanced no further , at least as far as I could see . 
A few folks even showed up * wearing caps bearing the colors and <unk> of both teams . 
`` I 'm for the <unk> today , but only because they lost yesterday . 
I love <unk> both . 
The only thing 0 I 'm <unk> for *T* is for the Series to go seven games , '' said *T* David Williams , a Sacramento <unk> , at the <unk> before Sunday 's go . 
The above represents a triumph of either <unk> or <unk> . 
I choose * to believe 0 it 's the latter , although it probably <unk> from the fact that just about everyone out here , including the A 's and <unk> , is originally from somewhere else . 
* <unk> it * to say that if this were a New York <unk> series , or one between the Chicago <unk> and White <unk> -LRB- <unk> , it 's possible -RRB- , you 'd need <unk> police in every other seat * to separate opposing fans , and only the <unk> would <unk> their <unk> . 
<unk> , the A 's gave you a lot of <unk> 0 * to root for *T* . 
In the opening game , besides <unk> and Stewart , there was Walt Weiss , a <unk> , <unk> <unk> who *T* had lost a couple months of the season to <unk> surgery . 
He was <unk> <unk> -LRB- <unk> in game two -RRB- , moved a <unk> along in the A 's <unk> second <unk> , and <unk> for his team 's final <unk> . 
Such <unk> is *T* his reputation among the East Bay <unk> that when he hit his first career home run last season *T* , the fan who *T* caught it agreed * to turn the ball over to him in return for an <unk> . 
Not his <unk> ; <unk> <unk> 's . 
An A 's <unk> of the second game was <unk> Henderson , who *T* <unk> the hot side of the <unk> <unk> . 
He <unk> Toronto in the <unk> with six hits , seven <unk> and eight stolen bases in 22 at <unk> , and continued that by * going <unk> at the plate Sunday , along with walking , <unk> a base and <unk> a run . 
`` When you 're in the <unk> *T* , you see every ball <unk> , '' he <unk> *T* . 
The cold guys in the set were Will Clark , Kevin Mitchell and <unk> Williams , the <unk> ' <unk> <unk> . 
They combined for 25 hits , six home runs and 24 runs <unk> in * in the five games against the <unk> . 
They went a collective <unk> here , with zero <unk> and <unk> . 
It 's that last set of numbers , as much as anything else , that *T* gives the <unk> hope in the Series games 0 *T* to come . 
`` I believe in the law of averages , '' declared *T* San Francisco <unk> coach <unk> Baker after game two . 
`` I 'd rather <unk> see a <unk> <unk> who *T* 's hot come up for the other side than a good <unk> who *T* 's cold . '' 
But the old <unk> <unk> <unk> offered no prediction about when good times would return to his side *T* . 
`` When it goes *T* , you never know when you 'll get it back *T* , '' he said *T* . 
`` That 's baseball . 
NCR Corp. reported a 10 % drop in third-quarter net income , * citing intense competition that *T* caused its gross profit margins to <unk> . 
Net income for the quarter fell to $ <unk> million *U* from $ <unk> million *U* , roughly what analysts had expected *T* . 
But per-share profit dropped only 2 % to $ <unk> *U* a share from $ <unk> *U* a share , as the company continued its stock buy-back plan . 
Average shares outstanding dropped to <unk> million from <unk> million . 
Revenue fell 1 % to $ <unk> billion *U* from $ <unk> billion *U* . 
The computer maker , which *T* sells more than half its goods outside the U.S. , also said 0 the negative effect of a stronger U.S. dollar will `` <unk> affect '' its fourth-quarter performance and `` make it <unk> difficult '' * to better 1988 results . 
NCR said 0 revenue declined both in the U.S. and overseas , * reflecting a world-wide softening of the computer markets . 
The company , however , said 0 orders in the U.S. showed `` good gains '' during the latest quarter . 
Analysts estimate those gains at 12 % to 13 % *U* , a good part of it coming from large orders placed * by a few of NCR 's major customers . 
In addition to a general slowing of the computer industry , NCR , which *T* sells automated <unk> machines and computerized cash <unk> , is also affected * by the retail and financial sectors , `` areas of the economy that *T* have generally not been robust , '' notes 0 *T* <unk> G. <unk> , an analyst for Salomon Brothers <unk> . 
These factors , combined with a strong dollar , should <unk> affect the current quarter 's results , NCR said 0 *T* . 
In the year-earlier fourth quarter , NCR had profit of $ <unk> million *U* , or $ <unk> *U* a share , on revenue of $ 1.8 billion *U* . 
Mr. <unk> said 0 he lowered his full-year estimates for 1989 to $ <unk> *U* a share from $ <unk> *U* a share . 
Revenue projections were slashed * to $ <unk> billion *U* from $ <unk> billion *U* . 
Last year , NCR had net income of $ <unk> million *U* , or $ <unk> *U* a share , on $ <unk> billion *U* in revenue . 
For the nine months , the company 's earnings fell 9 % to $ <unk> million *U* , or $ <unk> *U* a share , from $ <unk> million *U* , or $ <unk> *U* a share . 
<unk> declined 1 % to $ <unk> billion *U* from $ <unk> billion *U* . 
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , NCR shares fell 75 cents * to close at $ 57 *U* . 
* <unk> your Sept. 19 article `` Wall Street <unk> <unk> Analysts ' Pay to <unk> , '' I 'm delighted that Wall Street is finally <unk> in to the hard , cold facts of the real working world . 
If the firms are serious , however , why * limit the practice to the poor , <unk> analysts whose ability * to see into the future *T* is fragile at best *T* ? 
Why not * extend the same harsh standards to the sales force , and pay brokers a base salary with annual bonus based * on how much money they made *T* for their clients during the year *T* ? 
That should stop a lot of <unk> , and produce a stock market driven * only by professional concern , careful thought and good sense . 
Now , would n't that be a <unk> . 
<unk> <unk> <unk> Newport News , <unk> . 
Steve Clark , a Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. trader , reported for work at 5 a.m. , two and a half hours before the usual Monday morning strategy meeting . 
At Jefferies & Co. , J. Francis <unk> did n't reach the office until <unk> a.m. , but then he had been up most of the night at home . 
`` I had calls <unk> all night long from the States , '' he said *T* . 
`` I was <unk> * up every hour -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . 
People are looking for possible opportunities * to buy , but nobody wants * to stick their <unk> out . '' 
For many of London 's securities traders , it was a day that *T* started <unk> in the small hours . 
By <unk> , the selling was at <unk> <unk> . 
But as the day ended in a <unk> Wall <unk> rally , the City <unk> a <unk> of relief . 
So it went yesterday in the trading rooms of London 's financial district . 
In the wake of Wall Street 's plunge last Friday , the London market was considered * especially vulnerable . 
And before the opening of trading here yesterday , all eyes were on early trading in Tokyo for a <unk> as to how widespread the <unk> might be *T* . 
By the time 0 trading officially got under way at 9 a.m. *T* , the news from Asia was in . 
And it left mixed signals for London . 
Tokyo stocks closed off a significant but <unk> 1.8 % on thin volume ; Hong Kong stocks declined 6.5 % in orderly trading . 
At Jefferies ' trading room on <unk> <unk> , a <unk> circle at the edge of the financial district , desktop computer screens displayed the London market 's major barometer -- the Financial <unk> Exchange 100 Share Index . 
Red figures on the screens indicated falling stocks ; blue figures , rising stocks . 
Right away , the <unk> outnumbered the <unk> , 80 to 20 , as the index opened at <unk> , off <unk> points , or 7 % . 
`` I see concern , but I do n't see any panic , '' said *T* Mr. <unk> , a big , <unk> New York native who *T* runs the <unk> office . 
The Jefferies office , a branch of the Los Angeles-based firm , played it <unk> , * seeking * to avoid risk . 
`` This is not the sort of market 0 * to have a big position in *T* , '' said *T* David Smith , who *T* heads trading in all <unk> stocks . 
`` We tend * to run a very tight book . '' 
Jefferies spent most of its <unk> in the morning * trying * to match buyers and sellers , and there were n't many buyers . 
`` All the takeover stocks -- <unk> & <unk> , B.A.T , <unk> -- are getting pretty well <unk> * this morning , '' Mr. Smith said *T* . 
<unk> later , a <unk> `` sell '' order for <unk> & <unk> came in . 
For the third time in 15 minutes , a trader next to Mr. Smith left the <unk> area * to have a cigarette . 
On the screens , only two <unk> blue figures remained , but the index had recovered a few points and was off about 140 . 
`` Because Tokyo did n't collapse , * let 's pick up a little stock , '' Mr. Smith said *T* . 
He targeted <unk> shares of Reuters and <unk> a <unk> * to call up on his screen other dealers ' price quotes . 
The <unk> yellow figures showed the best price at <unk> pence , -LRB- $ <unk> *U* -RRB- and Mr. Smith 's traders started * putting out <unk> . 
But the market <unk> a serious buyer on a day dominated * by selling , and the quotes immediately jumped to 850 pence . 
`` When I want * to buy *T* , they run from you -- they keep changing their prices , '' Mr. Smith said *T* . 
`` It 's very <unk> . '' 
He temporarily abandoned his search for the Reuters shares . 
By this time , it was <unk> a.m. in New York , and Mr. Smith <unk> a call from a New York customer wanting an opinion on the British stock market , which *T* had been having troubles of its own even before Friday 's New York market break . 
`` <unk> dangerous <unk> , '' Mr. Smith said , *T* almost in a <unk> , `` <unk> . fundamentally weak <unk> fairly vulnerable still <unk> extremely <unk> poised <unk> 
we 're in for a lot of <unk> <unk> . '' 
He was right . 
By midday , the London market was in full retreat . 
`` It 's falling like a stone , '' said *T* Danny <unk> , a pit trader who *T* was standing outside the London International Financial Futures Exchange . 
Only half the usual <unk> crowd gathered at the <unk> <unk> & <unk> wine bar on Old <unk> Street nearby . 
<unk> was subdued as most <unk> watched the latest market statistics on television . 
At <unk> p.m. , the index hit its low , <unk> , off <unk> points . 
`` France opened the limit down , off at least 10 % if you could <unk> the index , which you could n't *T* , '' Mr. Clark , the Shearson trader , said *T* early in the afternoon . 
`` Spain is down 10 % and suspended * , Sweden 's down 8 % , Norway 11 % . 
This market has been very badly damaged * . '' 
As <unk> p.m. -- Wall Street 's opening time -- <unk> , Shearson traders and salesmen traded bets on how low the New York market would open *T* . 
In the center of the trading floor , chief trader Roger <unk> and two colleagues <unk> for the telephones as soon as the New York market opened -- * <unk> more than 60 points in the first few minutes . 
They saw an opportunity created * by the sell-off . 
As Wall Street traders dumped American <unk> <unk> in Jaguar PLC , Mr. <unk> and trader Sam <unk> bought them * to <unk> in the <unk> . 
Investors here still expect Ford Motor Co. or General Motors Corp. to bid for Jaguar . 
Suddenly , after about 45 minutes , the U.S. markets rallied . 
`` The <unk> has gone better , '' <unk> *T* one trader at about <unk> London time , as the U.S. Major Markets Index contract suddenly indicated a <unk> . 
As Wall Street strengthened , the London trading room went wild . 
Traders <unk> as their screens posted an <unk> loss on Wall Street . 
Then , nine minutes later , Wall Street suddenly rebounded to a gain on the day . 
`` <unk> ! <unk> ! <unk> ! '' <unk> *T* Shearson trader <unk> Rosen , * selling more Jaguar shares . 
`` This is panic buying ! '' 
As the London market rallied , some <unk> whether the weekend of worrying and <unk> had been worth it . 
The London index closed at <unk> , its high for the day , off <unk> , or about 3.3 % .

Is n't it <unk> just as fair * to say that if you have a million people working for you , every good thing that *T* has one chance in a million of * going right will go right at least once a year ? 
* Do n't be such a <unk> , Mr. <unk> .

The House Aviation <unk> approved a bill that *T* would give the transportation secretary authority * to review and approve leveraged buy-outs of major U.S. airlines . 
The collapsed plan * to acquire UAL Corp. , parent of United Airlines , spurred quick action on the legislation , introduced * Wednesday and approved * by the subcommittee on a voice vote yesterday . 
The bill is expected * to be taken * up by the Public Works and Transportation Committee tomorrow , and a floor vote by next week will be urged * . 
The measure drew criticism from the Bush administration and a <unk> shot from financier Donald Trump , who *T* yesterday withdrew his takeover bid for AMR Corp. , the parent of American Airlines . 
In a letter to subcommittee Chairman James <unk> -LRB- D. , Minn. -RRB- , Mr. Trump criticized the bill as an explicit effort * to thwart his bid for AMR , and said 0 it contributed to the collapse of the deal . 
<unk> <unk> , deputy transportation secretary , also sent a letter 0 *T* to express the administration 's opposition to the bill `` in its present form . '' 
Rep. <unk> <unk> off Mr. Trump 's allegations as an `` excuse for his own deal failing . '' 
He also said 0 the fact that the other letter had n't come from Transportation Secretary Samuel <unk> indicated 0 there is `` <unk> room '' in the administration 's position . 
Mr. <unk> and other committee members repeatedly stressed that the legislation was n't a response to any particular market situation . 
But they cited the UAL and AMR examples as reasons * to move quickly * to enact this legislation . 
<unk> both in the House and Senate said 0 the withdrawal of the Trump bid for AMR is n't likely * to <unk> efforts * to push the legislation . 
`` It 's still on the fast track and we still want * to do it , '' said *T* one Senate aide . 
The bill is aimed * at * addressing the concern that an airline might sacrifice costly safety measures * to pay off the debt incurred * in a leveraged buy-out . 
Currently , the transportation secretary does n't have clearly established authority to block mergers , but can take the drastic step of * <unk> the operating certificate of any carrier 0 the official considers *T* <unk> . 
<unk> of the legislation view the bill as an effort * to add stability and <unk> to the <unk> process , and * to preserve the safety and <unk> of the industry . 
In general , the bill would give the Transportation Department a 30-day review period before 15 % or more of the voting stock of a major U.S. air carrier could be acquired * . 
It also would require the acquiring party to notify the transportation secretary and to provide all information relevant to * determining the intent of the acquisition . 
The bill would allow the secretary to reject a buy-out if sufficient information has n't been provided * , or if the buy-out is likely * to weaken the carrier financially , result in a substantial reduction in size of the airline through disposal of assets , or give control to a foreign interest . 
If more information is needed * , the secretary would have authority * to extend the review period 20 days . 
All the witnesses , both congressmen and industry experts , expressed support for the bill in order * to prevent <unk> from * <unk> in on airline profits at the expense of safe , <unk> service . 
But several committee members <unk> , some backing Mr. Trump 's claim that the threat of regulation caused the failure of the UAL deal and the stock-market plunge . 
One of the major concerns expressed * by the <unk> was that large airlines would be prohibited * from * <unk> themselves of smaller entities and producing independent <unk> companies . 
In a possible <unk> to the <unk> of talks between Boeing Co. and striking <unk> union members , a federal <unk> said 0 representatives of the two sides will meet with him tomorrow .

`` We 're encouraged * that talks are scheduled * again but beyond that , we have made no expression of expectations , '' a Boeing spokesman said *T* . 
The <unk> union has rejected a three-year contract offer that *T* would have provided a 10 % wage increase over the life of the pact , plus some bonuses .

<unk> at Boeing continues with supervisors and other <unk> personnel <unk> the lines .

Boeing has declined * to say how many employees *T* are working at its giant <unk> , Wash. , plant . 
Union officials could n't be reached * for comment .

A <unk> spokesman declined * to elaborate on the group 's new plan . 
In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , <unk> shares jumped 62.5 cents * to close at $ <unk> *U* . 
<unk> , which *T* had been seeking a buyer for several months , announced a restructuring plan in September and took itself off the auction block .

West German Economics Minister Helmut <unk> said , `` In my view , the stock market will stabilize relatively quickly . 
There may be one or other psychological or technical reactions , but they are n't based * on fundamentals . 
The economy of West Germany and the EC -LCB- European Community -RCB- is highly stable . '' 
Paris , which *T* has been the center of speculation <unk> in recent weeks , also was hard hit * . 
Share prices fell in Milan , Amsterdam , Zurich , Madrid and Stockholm . 
Prices in Brussels , where a computer breakdown <unk> trading *T* , also tumbled . 
* Following is a breakdown of major market activity : 
<unk> : 
One of the <unk> declines came in the financial center of Europe 's strongest economy . 
The <unk> Index of 30 West German blue chips plunged 12.8 % , a one-day record , * <unk> out the summer 's gains . 
The index closed at <unk> , down <unk> points . 
By comparison , two years ago on Black Monday , the new index would have dropped 9.4 % , according to a projection by the exchange . 
Investors may have reacted so strongly to Friday 's U.S. stock market loss because they had <unk> memories of the Frankfurt exchange 's * losing 35 % of its value in the 1987 crash and its wake . 
This time , however , many small investors may have been hurt * by * acting so <unk> . 
`` They all went in the wrong direction , '' said *T* <unk> <unk> , an investment adviser for the Bank in <unk> 's Frankfurt branch . 
He said 0 he told clients * to buy selected West German blue chips after they fell by about 10 % . 
After the opening was delayed * 30 minutes because of the <unk> of sell orders , Frankfurt 's normal <unk> trading session was extended * 75 minutes * to handle the heavy volume . 
`` The beginning was <unk> , '' said *T* Nigel <unk> , a broker for <unk> AG . 
`` It took three-quarters of an hour before enough prices could be worked * out * to get a reading on the market . '' 
Institutional investors and bankers , many of whom *T* spent the night before in their offices * watching Far Eastern markets , were cautiously optimistic after the mild 1.8 % decline in Tokyo stock prices . 
`` Everybody <unk> was still confident , including most institutional investors . 
That is why everybody was a little surprised * by the storm of sell orders from small private investors *T* , '' said *T* <unk> <unk> , a senior trader for <unk> <unk> . 
Some big institutions , including banks , began * picking up <unk> shares late yesterday , but most investors wanted * to see what *T* would happen in New York before * acting . 
But even if Wall Street continues * to stabilize , analysts here say 0 the latest blow to investor confidence could <unk> a <unk> recovery for the Frankfurt exchange , which *T* already was showing signs of weakness after the <unk> had slipped from a 1989 high of <unk> on Sept. 8 . 
Some of West Germany 's <unk> chips took some of the biggest hits . 
A <unk> % drop for <unk> AG and Dresdner Bank AG 's 9.6 % decline were especially <unk> for their <unk> boards , whose plans for major rights issues in November *T* could now be in <unk> . 
Dresdner Bank last month said 0 it hoped * to raise 1.2 billion marks -LRB- $ <unk> million *U* -RRB- by * issuing four million shares at 300 marks each . 
Yet yesterday 's market <unk> Dresdner 's share price by 33 marks to <unk> marks a share , * leaving little incentive for investors to <unk> to the standing price unless the market <unk> quickly .

`` When Wall Street turned around shortly after the opening *T* , there was panic buying in Paris . '' 
Brokers said that as the news <unk> spread that Wall Street was moving up , traders who *T* had called * to place sell orders changed their line in <unk> , * ordering buys instead . 
Trading was driven * primarily by small investors and speculators , with large institutions waiting on the sidelines until late in the day . 
When Wall Street turned *T* , however , the big boys entered the market , * looking for bargains . 
J.P. Morgan & Co. swung to a loss in the third quarter , while NCNB Corp. reported 0 net income more than doubled , and Security Pacific Corp. net rose 10 % . 
J.P. Morgan & <unk> . 
J.P. Morgan , as * expected * , posted a $ <unk> billion *U* net loss for the quarter , * reflecting the New York bank 's decision <unk> last month * to add $ 2 billion *U* to reserves for losses on loans to <unk> countries . 
The reserve addition placed the parent of Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. among a few major U.S. banks that *T* have covered nearly all their medium and long-term portfolios to <unk> countries with reserves . 
The latest quarter 's loss equals $ <unk> *U* a share . 
In the year-earlier quarter , Morgan earned $ <unk> million *U* , or $ 1.25 *U* a share . 
George M. <unk> , analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. , called the results `` <unk> disappointing . '' 
* Excluding the $ 2 billion *U* provision and allowing for the taxes 0 Morgan paid *T* , earnings were about 65 cents a share , Mr. <unk> said 0 *T* . 
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Morgan climbed $ 1.50 *U* a share to $ <unk> *U* . 
Net interest income sank 27 % in the quarter to $ <unk> million *U* from $ <unk> million *U* .

Morgan received $ 2 million *U* of interest payments on its medium and long-term Brazilian loans ; had they been <unk> interest , net interest income would have been $ 35 million *U* higher in the quarter , Morgan said 0 *T* . 
Such loans to Argentina also remain classified as <unk> , * costing the bank $ 10 million *U* of interest income in the third period . 
Income from sources other than interest climbed 12 % to $ <unk> million *U* , * reflecting higher <unk> and other fees and gains on sales of investment securities . 
`` These increases were partly offset * by lower <unk> '' income , the bank said 0 *T* . 
<unk> expenses grew 16 % to $ <unk> million *U* . 
NCNB <unk> . 
NCNB Corp. 's net income more than doubled in the period , largely because of continued strong performance by the bank 's Texas operations . 
The Charlotte , N.C. , company said 0 earnings rose to $ <unk> million *U* , or $ <unk> *U* a share , from $ <unk> million *U* , or 69 cents a share , a year earlier . 
The latest quarter included a gain of $ <unk> million *U* , or 59 cents a share , related to the purchase of the remaining 51 % of NCNB Texas National Bank from the Federal Deposit Insurance <unk> . 
The strong performance , however , <unk> with an unexpectedly large increase in the size of NCNB 's problem loans , particularly in the Southeast . 
In the third quarter , nonperforming assets jumped to $ <unk> million *U* , or <unk> % of net loans and leases , from $ <unk> million *U* , or <unk> % in the second quarter . 
<unk> totaled $ <unk> million *U* , or <unk> % in the year-ago third quarter . 
<unk> * in the increase in the most recent quarter is *T* a $ 33 million *U* loan , which NCNB said 0 it `` expects *T* to be fully repaid * , with no loss , early in the fourth quarter . '' 
The deterioration in credit quality offset strong loan growth of 17 % in NCNB 's Southeast operations , as well as a 28 % growth in deposits resulting from an aggressive marketing campaign . 
The higher rates paid * on deposits also helped * squeeze NCNB 's net interest margin in the Southeast to <unk> % from <unk> % a year earlier . 
In Big Board composite trading yesterday , NCNB jumped $ 3.50 *U* a share , to $ 51 *U* . 
Results were released * after the market closed . 
NCNB Texas National , formed * from the <unk> of of the failed First RepublicBank Corp. of Dallas , contributed $ <unk> million *U* to NCNB 's bottom line in the third quarter .

Last week , the banking company said 0 it purchased both Freedom Savings & Loan Association , Tampa , Fla. , and University Federal Savings Association of San Antonio , Texas , for $ <unk> million *U* . 
In the first nine months , NCNB 's net income climbed 65 % to $ <unk> million *U* , or $ <unk> *U* a share , from $ <unk> million *U* , or $ <unk> *U* a share , a year earlier . 
Security Pacific <unk> . 
Security Pacific 's earnings growth slowed in the third quarter , but the Los Angeles bank holding company was still able * to post a 10 % increase in net income because of robust growth in residential real-estate and consumer loans . 
Net rose to $ <unk> million *U* , or $ <unk> *U* a share , from $ <unk> million *U* , or $ <unk> *U* a share , a year earlier . 
The company said 0 the gain resulted mainly from a $ 54 million *U* increase in net interest income , * reflecting a 33 % increase in real estate loans -LRB- mainly residential -RRB- , and a 19 % rise in consumer loans . 
These <unk> loans in effect replaced some <unk> assets such as <unk> loans , which *T* were allowed * to decrease . 
As a result , Security Pacific 's net interest margin fell only 13 basis points , a more mild decrease than some major banks outside California , which *T* have been reporting more sluggish earnings . 
Security Pacific shares closed at $ <unk> *U* , down 37.5 cents , in Big Board composite trading . 
The earnings represent a <unk> % return on assets for Security Pacific , and an <unk> % return on equity . 
The loan growth offset continuing real-estate loan losses in the depressed Arizona market . 
Security Pacific reported a 33 % increase in net credit losses for the quarter , to $ <unk> million *U* from $ <unk> million *U* in the year-ago period . 
<unk> loans grew slightly to $ 1.75 billion *U* at Sept. 30 , from $ 1.7 billion *U* a year ago . 
Security Pacific 's loan-loss provision was down 22 % , or $ <unk> million *U* , because it added to its <unk> reserve the year before .

<unk> expense grew only 4 % in the period . 
For the nine months , net rose 17 % to $ <unk> million *U* , or $ <unk> *U* a share , from $ <unk> million *U* , or $ <unk> *U* a share , a year earlier . 
LIN Broadcasting Corp. said 0 it <unk> n't take a position on a revised tender offer <unk> by McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. * to buy LIN and has asked for <unk> of the offer . 
The new offer , which *T* seeks <unk> % of the cellular and broadcasting concern , is for $ 125 *U* a share for 22 million LIN shares . 
McCaw 's revised tender offer would require McCaw to begin an auction process <unk> in July 1994 that *T* would buy out remaining holders at a per-share price roughly equivalent to what a third party might then have * to pay *T* for all of LIN . 
LIN is asking McCaw * to <unk> its tender offer , which *T* challenges an agreement <unk> between BellSouth Corp. and LIN * to merge their <unk> businesses . 
BellSouth has notified LIN that it would `` shortly respond to the McCaw proposal in as full and effective a manner as * is <unk> * . '' 
The LIN board said 0 holders may be <unk> * by the provision in the McCaw proposal that *T* `` guarantees '' private market value after five years for the remaining shares . 
McCaw has `` no obligation * to purchase and the definition of private market value is uncertain , '' the LIN board said 0 *T* . 
The board added that McCaw would be able * to control LIN 's operations and could , `` therefore , operate LIN in a manner which *T* could diminish its private market value and <unk> to a <unk> <unk> in five years . '' 
In national over-the-counter trading , LIN closed at $ <unk> *U* , down $ 2.75 *U* .

The U.S. trade representative declined * to put a dollar estimate on the losses resulting from the Canadian export restrictions . 
Canada initially had an export <unk> that *T* was replaced * by regulations requiring that such fish had * to be brought * <unk> in British Columbia by commercial <unk> prior to export . 
This action was defended * by the Canadian government on conservation grounds . 
Mrs. Hills said yesterday that the <unk> panel rejected this Canadian government argument . 
`` We fully expect that Canada will comply with the panel 's ruling '' that the `` landing requirement '' also must be ended * , she said 0 *T* . 
Earlier , an international panel set * up under the rules of the General Agreement on <unk> and Trade in Geneva determined that the original Canadian <unk> restrictions violated GATT rules .

Added <unk> another executive at a big bank : `` We were all a little <unk> over the weekend * trying * to forecast what *T* would happen -LCB- Monday -RCB- , but it 's been very quiet . 
Now , as for tomorrow , hell , who *T* knows ? 
What *T* happened Friday shows that financial markets are not yet sufficiently coordinated * * to handle another <unk> in prices . 
No <unk> with systems and procedures will ever prevent markets from * suffering a panic wave of selling . 
But markets can operate with greater or lesser efficiency . 
After the 1987 plunge , markets agreed that it <unk> would be wise * to halt trading whenever panic conditions arose *T* . 
The New York Stock Exchange adopted two specific circuit <unk> : If the Dow Jones index falls 250 points in a day , the exchange will halt trading for one hour ; if the decline hits 400 points , the exchange will close for an additional two hours . 
The <unk> is that an <unk> of trading will allow investors to reconsider their strategies , calm sellers and lead buyers to enter the market at indicated new price levels . 
It <unk> is impossible * to know whether that theory is realistic . 
A temporary <unk> of trading may indeed discourage a selling panic from * feeding on itself . 
But there is also the possibility that * <unk> down markets will <unk> fears and cause an even more <unk> slide in prices . 
What *T* happened Friday was the worst of all <unk> . 
The futures exchanges followed their own <unk> circuit <unk> and shut down at about 3 p.m. for 30 minutes , after the Standard & Poor 's 500 stock index had fallen 12 points , or about 100 points on the Dow Jones index . 
Options markets stopped trading in many securities . 
The New York Stock Exchange , under its own rules , remained open . 
With nowhere else 0 * to go *T* , sellers , and particularly program traders , focused all their selling on the New York Stock Exchange . 
As liquidity on that market weakened , prices fell sharply . 
Had the futures and options markets been open , additional liquidity would have been provided * and the decline , most probably , would have been less intense . 
At <unk> , after intense telephone negotiations between the trading markets and Washington , the futures exchanges <unk> . 
Futures trading , however , was halted * altogether at <unk> , after the futures markets had dropped an additional 30 points , which *T* is the daily limit for price declines . 
At this point , the options markets also shut down and once more left all sales to be handled * by the New York Stock Exchange . 
It is time 0 * to recognize that the New York Stock Exchange , the futures markets and the options markets , though <unk> separate , have actually become so closely <unk> * as * to constitute one market effectively *T* . 
Traders can vary their strategies and <unk> their orders in any one of them . 
It <unk> therefore makes no sense for each market to adopt different circuit <unk> . 
* To achieve maximum liquidity and minimize price volatility , either all markets should be open to trading or none . 
<unk> circuit <unk> would not have halted the slide in prices on Friday , but they probably would have made for <unk> , less volatile <unk> . 
It 's time for the exchanges and the Securities and Exchange Commission to agree on joint conditions for * <unk> trading or staying open . 
* Let 's not have one market shut down for 30 minutes when the Dow declines 100 points *T* and another shut down for an hour after a <unk> decline . 
The need for <unk> last-minute telephone negotiations among market officials will disappear once rules <unk> are in place that *T* <unk> circuit <unk> in all markets . 
The new circuit <unk> , if they are * to be applied * at all , will require that futures and options trading continue as long as the New York Stock Exchange remains open . 
The rules should be established * by agreement of the officials of all affected exchanges acting under the oversight <unk> and with the approval <unk> of the government regulatory agencies . 
Should the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission -LRB- which , with the SEC , *T* <unk> the Chicago stock-index markets -RRB- be unable * to agree , the issue may have * to be resolved * by decision of the Treasury secretary . 
In many ways , our financial markets are better prepared <unk> <unk> today * to handle a decline than they were *?* two years ago . 
The New York Stock Exchange now has the capacity * to handle a volume of nearly a billion shares a day . 
Telephone service <unk> has been improved * for customers trying * to reach their brokers , and specialists -- who I believe 0 *T* should stay , despite the <unk> of some post-crash critics -- have larger capital positions . 
-LRB- Of course , specialists ' actions alone can never prevent a major crack in stock prices .

Even if that is so , however , it <unk> 's probably the case that no barriers should have been <unk> * * to stop the <unk> before the end of the <unk> -LRB- <unk> -RRB- . 
The <unk> began Friday afternoon when word <unk> spread that the UAL buy-out was <unk> *T* . 
Although the <unk> expects * to <unk> together a substitute offer , consisting of less cash , the failure * to get cash from Japanese and American banks confirmed a growing fear <unk> among arbitragers that the <unk> of <unk> takeover deals is ending . 
<unk> of other <unk> <unk> made up the <unk> , of course -- notably a surprisingly large increase in producer prices , <unk> Federal Reserve <unk> ; and the Bush administration 's -LRB- temporary ? -RRB- defeat in * trying * to lower the capital-gains tax . 
As usual , few favorable reviews <unk> were heard * for that <unk> <unk> band of program traders , although most serious studies suggest 0 they only play the music that others write *T* . 
What *T* really <unk> the crowds along Wall Street , however , was the sudden concern that , whatever the reason , the pool of debt capital is <unk> up . 
Gray Friday reflects a panic mainly by the takeover arbitragers , rather than the small investor , as their highly <unk> investments in the `` deal '' stocks are <unk> * by the unexpected <unk> up of the <unk> for deal financing . 
<unk> stocks led the market down as they absorbed the <unk> losses . 
UAL , which *T* triggered the slide , opened Monday at $ <unk> *U* , down about 20 % from Thursday 's close . 
AMR opened Monday at $ 80 *U* , down nearly 20 % from Thursday 's close .

The market for so-called junk bonds has been setting the stage for Friday 's dramatic march for several weeks . 
The growing financial difficulties of recent <unk> restructurings or takeovers , such as Resorts International , Integrated Resources , and Campeau 's retailing empire , have cast a <unk> over the entire market for high-yield securities . 
Investors have reacted by * ignoring recent efforts * to <unk> junk bonds by Ohio <unk> and by * forcing Ramada to postpone indefinitely its planned junk-bond sale and restructuring . 
As a result , high-yield mutual funds have declined across the board and the many firms planning * to sell $ 11 billion *U* in junk bonds before year-end are experiencing anxious times . 
These are all market <unk> -LRB- * putting aside the artificial boosts that the tax code gives *T* to debt over equity -RRB- , and what we 've seen *T* is the market <unk> them in . 
Of course , Washington had n't been silent in the days leading up to the debacle , and its tendency * to <unk> in the leverage <unk> remains a <unk> prospect , but those preliminary steps should n't <unk> us from the basic market <unk> that *T* was at work on Friday . 
If it <unk> is correct * to find that concerns over corporate debt and <unk> caused Gray Friday , what are *T* the implications for policy makers ? 
After all , the stock market 's response to the collapse of the UAL deal might be taken * to confirm the <unk> direction of regulators . 
Is this a case where private markets are approving of Washington 's <unk> of Wall Street *T* ? 
<unk> not . 
To the extent that Friday 's sell-off reflected a sudden <unk> of the <unk> of leverage , the message is that Wall Street and the private markets are fully capable of * imposing the appropriate incentives and sanctions on corporate behavior . 
The national economic interests are much better served * * allowing the private interests of bankers and investors be the ultimate judges of the investment quality of various LBO deals and leveraged restructurings . 
The recent difficulties in the junk-bond markets and the <unk> of bank capital for recent deals underscores the wisdom of * letting the free markets operate . 
If takeover premiums become excessive , if LBO <unk> become too aggressive , then the private market will recognize these problems more quickly and accurately than will *?* policy makers , and the markets will move with <unk> speed * to impose appropriate sanctions . 
Yes , the broader exchanges got caught up in the <unk> , but they <unk> the <unk> up all year . 
Not surprisingly , he sometimes <unk> . 
The arbitragers and takeover <unk> got killed * on Gray Friday , while the <unk> managers of prospective targets <unk> <unk> . 
If you identify with the <unk> managers , you must concede that <unk> and effective relief from the <unk> of the takeover market is more likely * to come from the marketplace than from Washington . 
If you side with the arbitragers and raiders , you clearly have more * to fear from private investors than from regulators , although the Delaware courts should never be <unk> * . 
The truth is , Washington understands politics better than economics . 
Although the average citizen is probably not <unk> * too much from Washington 's <unk> war against Wall Street regarding excessive financial <unk> , actual legislation would probably impose considerable harm . 
Any such attempt * to <unk> `` good debt '' from `` bad debt , '' or to draw the line at a particular industry , such as the airlines , is likely * to blunt the spur that the proper amount of leverage provides *T* both to equity markets and economic efficiency in general . 
Far better for policy makers to concentrate on the war against drugs , Panama and the deficit , all of them <unk> that *T* seem * never to end .

Shares also closed sharply lower across Europe , particularly in Frankfurt , although London and a few other markets recovered some ground after stocks began * to rebound in New York . 
Other Asian and Pacific markets had <unk> losses than Tokyo , but the selling wave stopped short of * <unk> another market crash . 
All eyes were on Tokyo at the opening because it was the first major market 0 *T* to trade since Friday 's <unk> plunge on Wall Street . 
But rather than * set the tone for other markets , Japan 's major institutional investors chose * to remain on the sidelines . 
Still , despite the sudden <unk> of stock-market <unk> , managers of Japanese investment funds said 0 they were n't planning * to <unk> U.S. or European equities . 
`` We did n't trade much today , as our policy now is * to wait and see , '' said *T* a fund manager at <unk> Life Insurance <unk> . 
`` We would like * to wait and see until trading goes around through Europe and New York . '' 
The institutions appeared confident that Japanese regulators would step in * to ensure orderly trading if necessary , and there was considerable speculation <unk> during the day that the Finance Ministry was working behind the scenes * to do just that . 
But in the absence of <unk> trading , its presence was never <unk> felt * . 
At the close , the Nikkei average of 225 stocks stood at <unk> , down <unk> points , or 1.8 % . 
The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index sank <unk> , or 1.7 % , to <unk> . 
The day 's decline was generally in line with analysts ' weekend predictions . 
<unk> issues <unk> <unk> , <unk> . 
But volume was thin at <unk> million shares , compared with <unk> million Friday . 
The market opened sharply lower , with the Nikkei average down nearly 600 after 20 minutes . 
A <unk> rebound brought it back * to show a gain of about 200 at the end of the morning session , but the rally failed in the afternoon , and the market closed near the day 's low . 
The smaller stocks in the Tokyo market 's second section also posted their biggest decline of the year . 
The Tokyo Stock Exchange index for the second section fell <unk> , or 2.7 % , to <unk> . 
Many investors , trying * to <unk> the market 's major indexes , have <unk> to these small issues in recent weeks . 
Japanese investors and traders expressed relief that the Tokyo market did n't fall more sharply . 
But its performance did bear some <unk> to events of two years ago , during the October 1987 global stock market crash . 
On Oct. 16 , 1987 -- the Friday before the Black Monday crash -- the New York market dropped 4.6 % , and Tokyo followed on Monday with a 2.4 % drop . 
This time , Wall Street 's plunge of 6.9 % Friday was followed * by yesterday 's 1.8 % loss in Tokyo . 
Two years ago , Tokyo 's biggest fall came the day after New York 's <unk> % Black Monday plunge , when the Nikkei average fell 14.9 % *T* . 
Thus , market participants yesterday were looking ahead <unk> to Wall Street 's opening . 
But in New York yesterday , the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged <unk> * to close at <unk> on heavy volume of <unk> shares , although declining issues still outnumbered advancing ones on the broad market . 
<unk> <unk> , a director at Yamaichi Investment Trust & Management Co. , called yesterday 's session `` a good scenario '' for Japan . 
`` Now we are looking for the time 0 * to place buy orders *T* , '' he said *T* . 
`` For us institutional investors , the chance for buying has come . '' 
<unk> <unk> , general manager of the investment research department at <unk> Trust & Banking Co. , also was optimistic . 
He described Friday 's plunge in the U.S. as a `` <unk> '' event resulting in part from excessive merger and acquisition activity . 
`` Unless there is a panic , this is the best time 0 * to buy *T* , as was the case *?* two years ago , '' he said *T* . 
`` Those shares which *T* had posted gains on <unk> speculation were <unk> * with cold water , but as far as major stocks are concerned * , there is n't much impact . '' 
Other fund managers were similarly <unk> . 
`` We have no plans * to adjust our asset allocation in foreign equities , '' said *T* <unk> <unk> , chief portfolio manager in the pension fund management department at <unk> Trust & Banking <unk> . 
He said 0 Friday 's Wall Street decline was `` well within the range of volatility '' that <unk> Trust plans for *T* when it charts its overseas investment strategy *T* . 
Among other Asian and Pacific markets , Malaysia and Singapore had the biggest losses , with the <unk> <unk> composite index in Malaysia falling 11.5 % and Singapore 's <unk> Times Industrial Index down 10 % . 
Major indexes declined more than 8 % in Australia and New Zealand and 6.5 % in Hong Kong . 
<unk> , Manila , Seoul , Taipei and <unk> escaped with slightly smaller losses . 
Brokers and fund managers said 0 the region 's markets were <unk> to Friday 's Wall Street plunge even though that decline was due to local factors such as failed corporate buy-outs and a deteriorating junk-bond market . 
`` It 's pure psychology , '' said *T* William <unk> <unk> , an account executive for Drexel Burnham Lambert -LRB- <unk> -RRB- Ltd. in Hong Kong . 
`` Markets in this region are n't so <unk> * to leveraged buy-outs , and their economies generally are in good shape , but there 's no doubt that Asia is still following America 's lead . '' 
Several analysts said 0 Malaysia and Singapore had the biggest losses because they are relatively open to rapid cash flows . 
Hong Kong is the region 's next most open market , but many foreign investors have been staying away from it since it plunged in June amid political turmoil in China . 
`` Singapore took the hit because when people want * to get out *T* , they tend * to go where the liquidity is *T* , '' said *T* Elizabeth <unk> , a regional analyst with <unk> Securities -LRB- Hong Kong -RRB- <unk> . 
She pointed out that even after Monday 's 10 % decline , the <unk> Times index is up 24 % this year , so investors who *T* <unk> out generally did so <unk> . 
Similarly , <unk> <unk> 's composite index yesterday ended <unk> % above its 1988 close . 
In Hong Kong , the <unk> <unk> Index fell <unk> * to finish at <unk> . 
Trading was heavy at about one billion shares , compared with <unk> million Friday . 
But the session was orderly , in contrast to the market 's <unk> <unk> after the 1987 crash . 
Richard <unk> , a director at Hong <unk> <unk> International Fund <unk> Ltd. , said 0 the market probably has n't hit bottom yet but is close . 
`` If New York does n't collapse , I see maybe another 5 % on the <unk> , * not counting the risk of bad news out of China , '' he said *T* . 
In Australia , Sydney 's All <unk> index closed at <unk> , down 8.1 % , its biggest drop since October 1987 . 
But volume rose only to <unk> million shares from <unk> million Friday . 
<unk> <unk> , an analyst at brokerage firm <unk> , <unk> & Young Ltd. , described the market 's performance as `` <unk> '' as investors fled to <unk> Australian stocks and <unk> entrepreneurial companies 0 they perceived *T* as * having any takeover premium built into the price . 
London 's Financial <unk> Exchange 100-share index , the most closely watched market barometer , ended at its intraday high of <unk> , down <unk> , or 3.2 % . 
At its low , shortly before Wall Street opened , it was off more than 130 points . 
The Financial Times 30-share index closed <unk> points lower at <unk> . 
Volume more than doubled to <unk> million shares from <unk> million Friday . 
Prices on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange tumbled in heavy trading . 
The decline in the German Stock Index of <unk> points , or 12.8 % , to <unk> was the Frankfurt market 's <unk> fall ever . 
Retail investors dumped holdings on a massive scale , * pushing some blue-chip shares down as much as 20 % . 
Analysts cited memories of two years ago , when many small investors held on to their shares after the October crash but the West German market continued * to decline <unk> for the next three months *T* . 
Here are price trends on the world 's major stock markets , as * calculated * by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective , Geneva . 
* To make them directly comparable , each index is based * on the close of 1969 equaling 100 . 
The percentage change is since year-end . 
Frank Lloyd Wright is reported * to have said once that if you <unk> the world on its side , everything loose would end up in California . 
We 've always thought that Mr. Wright <unk> California 's <unk> , but maybe the state 's <unk> factions are starting * to <unk> the forces that *T* made it such a significant place . 
What else is one * to make *T* of the <unk> <unk> initiative just proposed * by several major environmental groups and organized * by the state 's attorney general ? 
If * passed * by the voters , the recently announced initiative would phase out major <unk> , reduce carbon <unk> emissions by 40 % , ban new offshore drilling , ban chemicals thought * to <unk> the ozone layer , and create a new state environmental officer armed * with a $ 40 million *U* budget 0 * to sue any firm or agency 0 he thinks 0 *T* is being too dirty *T* . 
The initiative is based * largely on the <unk> of the green lobby : the Sierra Club , the League of <unk> <unk> , the Natural Resources Defense Council , the National <unk> <unk> and the Citizens for a Better <unk> . 
<unk> , the Environmental Defense Fund is having nothing 0 * to do *T* with this one . 
Not only <unk> but all Americans would pay if this thing passed . 
The initiative bars the sale of any crops <unk> in California that *T* do n't meet the initiative 's standards . 
Kansas wheat farmers and Florida fruit growers would have * to adjust or give up the California market . 
In other words , California is <unk> * to take control of the nation 's farm policy . 
As usual the green lobby 's proposal is <unk> * from scientific reality . 
* Consider the <unk> provision . 
The proposed initiative would mandate a reduction of carbon <unk> of 40 % . 
Even if one buys into the whole <unk> theory , it <unk> is <unk> that reductions in a single state could have any impact on what *T* is billed * as a global problem . 
But if rational science and economics have nothing 0 * to do *T* with the new environment initiative , what *T* is going on ? 
The first place 0 * to look *T* under these circumstances is at the ways in which the sponsors themselves will benefit *T* . 
The key here is the <unk> of state Attorney General John Van de <unk> . 
He 's running for governor . 
Mr. Van de <unk> is the one who *T* collected the plans from the various radical environmental groups and <unk> them into a single <unk> initiative 0 *T* to be placed * on the ballot for election on Nov. 6 , 1990 . 
That 's also the day of the <unk> election . 
The initiative seems * to have been <unk> * * to include all the hot issues that *T* set off the wealthy Hollywood <unk> who *T* <unk> money . 
And it allows Mr. Van de <unk> to get around campaign spending limits . 
He can spend the legal maximum for his campaign ; all the spending for the Van de <unk> initiative -LRB- on which there are no limits *T* -RRB- is <unk> . 
This initiative is being labeled * The Big Green , but maybe it should be called * The Big <unk> . 
-LRB- The Republican candidate , Sen. Pete Wilson , is playing the initiative <unk> game too , * <unk> his own crime initiative . -RRB- 
While it <unk> is possible that the Big Green initiative will be ruled * unconstitutional , it <unk> is of course <unk> that in modern California it could slide through . 
This is the state that *T* recently passed the <unk> 65 <unk> initiative . 
If this new proposal ever does become law , the green lobby will benefit directly . 
The initiative creates a free floating state environmental officer 0 *T* to sue companies or government agencies that *T* do things 0 he does n't like *T* . 
That means 0 the <unk> and such groups no longer would have * to spend as much money on litigation ; taxpayers would bear the cost . 
Mr. Van de <unk> and his allies may be hoping that the environment is such a <unk> and <unk> issue <unk> among certain segments of California 's population now that almost any collection of <unk> , <unk> <unk> can pass under its <unk> . 
Of course the state 's liberals are not yet a nation <unk> themselves . 
George Bush , for example , may decide that he does n't want * to be the President who *T* lost control of interstate commerce to an attorney general from California . 
And some other segments of California 's political and media culture may yet start * to point out that the initiative would impose significant costs on the state 's less affluent citizens in the form of higher food prices and lost jobs . 
This <unk> initiative will help California define itself for the future either as a state still <unk> * to economic and scientific reality , or as one being led * to <unk> its <unk> activists want * to take it *T* . 
First , there was a death watch . 
Then <unk> . 
* <unk> * by waves of large-scale buying in blue-chip stocks , the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied yesterday and <unk> about a half of Friday 's <unk> plunge , * gaining <unk> to <unk> . 
It was the <unk> advance for the average of 30 blue chips , on <unk> New York Stock Exchange volume of <unk> shares -- the highest since the days after the 1987 crash . 
While the advance <unk> investors who *T* feared 0 a <unk> crash would occur yesterday , it was strictly a <unk> rally fed * by huge buying by <unk> institutions and program traders . 
A <unk> sign : <unk> stocks on the Big Board outnumbered <unk> , <unk> to <unk> , and the over-the-counter market that *T* includes many smaller stocks suffered <unk> of Friday 's late Big Board plunge . 
The Nasdaq OTC index closed down <unk> to <unk> . 
Meanwhile , in a <unk> in two of the market 's most important indicators , the Dow industrials ' sister average , the <unk> Dow Jones Transportation Average , tumbled <unk> to <unk> -- its <unk> decline next to the <unk> fall during the 1987 crash . 
<unk> plunged on takeover <unk> in two airline stocks , UAL and AMR , which *T* each fell more than 20 % when they <unk> for trading yesterday after * being suspended * Friday afternoon *T* . 
UAL , the takeover stock at the center of Friday 's <unk> market plunge , fell 56 <unk> to <unk> <unk> on nearly 2.3 million shares . 
Overall , `` this is a <unk> rally but it 's very selective , '' said 0 *T* Arthur <unk> Jr. , a veteran PaineWebber Inc. trader at the Big Board . 
`` Everyone was a little concerned about the general <unk> of the rally and failure <unk> of the OTC market * to get into plus territory . 
It 's just a strange feeling . 
I do n't think 0 anyone left the place * <unk> <unk> . '' 
The rally gave <unk> , at least for now , to the <unk> declaration <unk> of Big Board Chairman John J. <unk> Jr. that Friday 's market debacle was `` an <unk> condition , and not a disaster . '' 
But to traders , it looked like disaster on the <unk> a.m. opening <unk> . 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average opened down <unk> shortly after <unk> . 
But most of the 30 blue-chip stocks in the average , including Eastman Kodak and General Motors , could n't trade because of the heavy backlog of sell orders left * over from Friday 's <unk> <unk> . 
At <unk> , Procter & Gamble -- one of the most important Dow <unk> of late -- opened down 2 <unk> to <unk> . 
The Dow dropped to a quick <unk> loss , and to many traders it looked as if stocks were headed * for yet another big tumble . 
More stocks opened over the <unk> half hour , as the 49 Big Board specialist firms in charge of * keeping the market orderly <unk> * to find buy orders from major brokerage firms 0 *T* to match the selling flood . 
Then , * to make matters worse , computerized sell programs <unk> in , * <unk> stocks into <unk> losses . 
There was heavy stock-index arbitrage , as traders sold big <unk> of stock and bought stock-index futures * to profit from the price <unk> between the two markets . 
This was a <unk> from Friday , when Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index futures had closed at a sharp discount to stocks *T* . 
The <unk> of the program selling <unk> any hopes that some of the big program trading firms would hold off until the market <unk> . 
They did n't *?* . 
The Dow accelerated its slide , * losing <unk> in the first 40 minutes of trading . 
With program traders seemingly in charge , buyers backed away from the market and watched stocks fall . 
Then at <unk> the Dow suddenly started * to rebound , and when it shot upward *T* it did so even faster than the <unk> fall . 
And this time , it was n't just the program traders who *T* were responsible . 
All the selling had pushed stocks to such cheap values that big investment banks and major money management firms started * buying stocks heavily . 
The program traders were in there , too , of course . 
But according to one trader , the <unk> `` did n't look as dominant on the upside as on the <unk> because there was -LCB- also -RCB- a lot of <unk> '' by institutions . 
<unk> M. <unk> , director of the New Jersey Division of Investment , which *T* oversees $ 29 billion *U* in investments , said 0 the `` first thing 0 we did *T* was * to double our orders '' yesterday morning . 
`` With the market down like this , we 'll probably take another $ 50 million *U* and put it in '' the market . 
Trading in Walt Disney Co. particularly caught traders ' eyes . 
According to Big Board officials , Disney had one of the biggest <unk> imbalances on Friday ; it was one of the seven stocks that *T* could n't finish trading that day . 
The stock opened late at <unk> <unk> , down 8 <unk> . 
But then it shot upward 7 <unk> as Goldman , Sachs & Co. stepped in and bought , traders said 0 *T* . 
However , Disney specialist Robert <unk> said : `` I would be surprised * if Goldman represented 4 % of the opening volume . '' 
<unk> Wall Street , trading <unk> were relieved * that they could at least play the market yesterday , in contrast to Friday 's <unk> . 
At Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. , head equity trader <unk> <unk> said : `` I think 0 the opening was constructive . 
It was orderly . 
We put some orders together . 
There was n't a lot of panic selling , either <unk> or internationally <unk> . 
Not like Friday where they just took -LCB- the market -RCB- apart *T* . '' 
Still , the market had n't yet crossed into positive territory , and traders were <unk> . 
But in another dramatic burst , the Dow <unk> on 42 points in five minutes , and at <unk> the index showed a gain of <unk> . 
On the Big Board floor and on trading <unk> , traders <unk> their approval . 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , a trader in Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 's OTC department : `` I tell you , 0 this market acts * healthy . '' 
<unk> him , scores of traders seemed * to get a burst of energy ; their boss broke out bottles of <unk> water * to cool them off . 
Among Big Board specialists , the cry was `` * <unk> your offers '' -- * meaning that specialists soon expected * to get higher prices for their shares . 
`` It was <unk> on the upside , '' said *T* one Big Board specialist . 
But not everybody was making money . 
The <unk> on the Chicago Board Options Exchange , the nation 's major options market , was heavy after the trading in S&P 100 stock-index options was halted * Friday . 
Many market makers in the S&P 100 index options contract had bullish positions Friday , and when the shutdown came *T* they were frozen * with huge losses . 
Over the weekend , clearing firms told the Chicago market makers * to get out of their positions at any cost Monday morning . 
`` They were absolutely killed * , <unk> * , '' said *T* one Chicago-based options trader . 
Some traders said that the closely watched Major Market Index , whose 20 stocks *T* <unk> the Dow industrials , did n't lead yesterday 's big rally . 
James <unk> , a partner at specialist Fowler & <unk> , said , `` The difference between today and two years ago '' -- `` <unk> Tuesday , '' Oct. 20 , 1987 -- `` is that then we needed a <unk> to go into the Major Market Index , spend $ 2 million *U* and get the program rally started * . 
This time -LCB- institutions -RCB- saw the programs coming and backed away and backed away . 
Then when the market was at a technical level 0 * to buy *T* *T* , they came in with a <unk> . '' 
However , according to one analyst , the timing of Major Market Index futures buying just before the turnaround was similar to that of <unk> Tuesday . 
`` Futures were pulling the stock market higher , '' said *T* Donald <unk> , head of stock-index futures research at Prudential-Bache Securities <unk> . 
Although the Big Board 's specialist firms <unk> through another highly volatile trading session , their performance yesterday was better than during Friday 's <unk> chaos , according to traders and brokers who *T* work with them . 
<unk> were criticized * for their inability * to maintain orderly markets during the Friday plunge . 
But yesterday , even with <unk> in such major blue-chip stocks as Merck , `` we expected -LRB- the <unk> -RRB- and it was n't too bad , '' said 0 *T* Donaldson 's Mr. <unk> , who *T* had been critical of the specialists ' performance on Friday . 
According to a Big Board official , while many stocks opened late , there were subsequent trading <unk> in only three issues -- AMR , Merck and <unk> Energy . 
Merck is one of the most important stocks in the Major Market Index . 
No sector of the market has been <unk> * during the past two days ' <unk> . 
Yet from the Dow industrials ' high on Oct. 9 through Friday 's plunge , relatively good performances have been turned * in by real-estate , utilities , precious metals and life insurance stocks . 
And yesterday , the top performing industry group was oil field equipment issues . 
For example , <unk> jumped 3 <unk> to 38 , <unk> rose 2 <unk> to 43 <unk> and Baker Hughes rose 1 <unk> to 22 . 
Because of the UAL and AMR <unk> , airlines were the <unk> sector of the market yesterday . 
Philip Morris was the Big Board 's most active issue , * rising 2 <unk> to 43 <unk> on nearly eight million shares . 
Among other major issues , Coca-Cola Co. closed up 2 at 66 <unk> on 1.7 million shares and American Telephone & Telegraph rose 3 <unk> to 43 on nearly 7.8 million shares . 
Shares of International Business Machines , which *T* reported earnings yesterday , finished at 103 , up 1 , after * slipping below 100 during Friday 's session for the first time in five years . 
Shares of three brokerage firms rose after they reported earnings . 
Merrill Lynch added 1 <unk> to 28 , PaineWebber rose <unk> to 18 <unk> and Bear Stearns rose <unk> to 14 <unk> . 
Federal National Mortgage Association , a recently hot stock , climbed 4 to <unk> on nearly 1.6 million shares . 
At a news conference after the close of trading yesterday , the Big Board 's Mr. <unk> and other exchange officials praised the performance of their computers and personnel . 
Mr. <unk> said that program trading strategies were n't responsible for * <unk> Friday 's decline despite a jump in the use of the <unk> strategies in recent months . 
Some 24 million of the more than 100 million shares traded * in the final 90 minutes of Friday 's session , when the plunge in stock prices was concentrated * *T* , were <unk> , he said 0 *T* . 
Program trades make up 10 % of the exchange 's volume on an average day , but despite the increase Friday , it was `` certainly not something 0 you would say 0 *T* <unk> the market decline , '' Mr. <unk> said 0 *T* . 
Mr. <unk> expressed relief that the market rebounded yesterday . 
`` Obviously , every time 0 we get this kind of reaction *T* , it 's going * to make everybody <unk> nervous , including me , '' he said *T* . 
He said that exchange officials had conversations with Wall Street firms throughout the weekend and that `` all the participants <unk> very , very <unk> today . '' 
Meanwhile , Peter <unk> , Shearson 's head of retail equity trading , praised institutional investors in the OTC market , who *T* were heavy buyers of the Nasdaq 's biggest technology issues yesterday amid a flood of selling by other investors . 
`` The institutions <unk> n't be criticized * for their behavior , '' Mr. <unk> said *T* in an interview . 
`` It was the opposite of what *T* happened on Oct. 19 . 
They used their judgment . 
They did n't panic during the first round of selling this morning . 
Instead , they bought on weakness and sold into the strength , which *T* kept the market orderly . 
Maybe they learned from experience . '' 
Mr. <unk> said 0 the performance of specialists during Friday 's plunge was <unk> , because out of <unk> Big Board common stocks traded * during the day only seven *T* were closed * and were n't <unk> * before the close . 
`` They did an excellent job , '' Mr. <unk> said *T* of the specialists . 
Wall Street traders on Friday had complained about the trading <unk> . 
James A. White and <unk> <unk> contributed to this article . 
West Germany 's Green Party joined its ideological <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> Institute in the legal battle 0 * to ground the <unk> shuttle and its <unk> <unk> probe to <unk> *T* . 
The <unk> <unk> wanted a Washington federal appeals court to block today 's scheduled <unk> long enough for them to ask the World Court * to `` order '' a permanent cancellation of the $ 1.5 billion *U* flight . 
A <unk> appeals panel yesterday refused * to comply , though liberal Judge Pat <unk> went out of her way * to deny that this was a `` <unk> '' case . 
Of course it was *?* . 
NASA should now sue for fines against all three <unk> , foreign and domestic , for * bringing this <unk> case . 
A House-Senate conference approved a permanent smoking ban on all domestic airline routes within the <unk> U.S. and on all flights of six hours or less to Alaska and Hawaii . 
The restrictions would cover all but a small percentage of domestic air traffic , and represent a major expansion of the current smoking ban on flights of two hours or less . 
The exemption allowed * on longer flights to Alaska and Hawaii appears * to be largely a <unk> concession for the traditionally powerful tobacco industry , which *T* has found itself increasingly isolated in the face of public pressure in recent years . 
By a <unk> margin , House negotiators initially rejected last night a Senate provision covering all domestic flights . 
But the <unk> compromise was soon agreed to * in subsequent discussions . 
As a practical matter , flights from the West Coast to Hawaii would be covered * as they are under the time limit , but the language would exempt longer routes beginning , for example , in Chicago or on the East Coast . 
Within the Senate , the ban has had aggressive support from Sen. Frank <unk> -LRB- D. , N.J. -RRB- , who *T* has used his position as a Senate Appropriations subcommittee chairman * to <unk> votes for the initiative . 
The measure is attached * to the more than $ 26 billion *U* fiscal 1990 transportation bill within Mr. <unk> 's jurisdiction , and the final compromise is <unk> * with more than $ <unk> million *U* in road projects <unk> * by members as well as funds sought * by major airports , including Denver . 
From the <unk> , the tobacco industry has been uncertain as to what strategy * to follow *T* . 
But the industry retains support in the House leadership through the influence of <unk> states , such as North Carolina . 
Majority <unk> William Gray owes a political debt to Southern agriculture lawmakers for his rise in the House , and the Philadelphia Democrat used his position in the conference * to <unk> the exemption from a total ban . 
Although the smoking provision has attracted the most public interest , the underlying bill was the subject of <unk> lobbying because of its impact on air transportation and the more <unk> , but politically important , projects of members . 
In a <unk> lesson in the power of the appropriations committees , the House deliberately killed a handful of projects backed * by lawmakers in Florida , Illinois and Pennsylvania who *T* had voted against the panel leadership on the House floor . 
`` <unk> can vote as they want *?* , '' said *T* Rep. William Lehman -LRB- D. , Fla. -RRB- , head of the House conferees . 
`` But if you make a request , you should support the committee . '' 
Within the Federal Aviation Administration , the final bill promises * to increase spending for facilities and equipment by more than 20 % from last year , and total operations would rise to $ <unk> billion *U* -- a 12 % boost . 
The facilities account includes $ 40 million *U* for Denver 's ambitious new airport , and the competition for these funds created shifting alliances between urban lawmakers representing established airports in Philadelphia and Michigan and the major carriers to Denver , United and Continental . 
* <unk> of the costs -- and , critics say , competition -- the airlines have sought * to gain leverage over the city of Denver . 
Texas Air Corp. , which *T* owns Continental , and the Air Transport Association were prominent in the lobbying . 
The industry sought * to impose conditions that *T* would have delayed funds for the project until Denver and the airlines had agreed to leases for 50 % of the <unk> . 
But this was rejected * in favor of much <unk> language <unk> the Transportation Department * to review the costs of the first phase , expected * to cost about $ 2 billion *U* . 
Though smaller in total dollars , the conference agreed * to preserve an estimated $ <unk> million *U* in controversial subsidies to carriers serving rural or isolated airports . 
The sum is more than double what the House had approved *T* for the program , but the list of qualified airports would be cut * by 22 under new distance requirements and limits on the level of subsidy . 
Congress previously cut six airports this year . 
The impact of the changes is * to eliminate many of the most excessive cases where the government has been paying more than $ 200 *U* for each passenger in subsidies *T* . 
Among rail and highway accounts , the agreement provides $ <unk> million *U* for <unk> , including $ 85 million *U* for capital improvements . 
And <unk> grants for mass transit would be effectively frozen * at $ 1.625 billion *U* , or $ 20 million more *U* than last fiscal year . 
* <unk> several <unk> movie hits including `` <unk> , '' Los Angeles-based <unk> Entertainment Co. reported earnings for the first quarter ended Aug. 31 of $ 5.8 million *U* , or 50 cents a share , compared with a year-earlier loss . 
Sony Corp. , which *T* has offered * to acquire the <unk> company , is seeking * to free its top executives , Peter <unk> and Jon Peters , from an exclusive agreement with Time Warner Inc. 's Warner Communications Inc. so they can run Columbia Pictures Entertainment <unk> . 
Sony two weeks ago agreed * to acquire Columbia for $ 3.4 billion *U* , or $ 27 *U* a share . 
Warner sued Sony and <unk> late last week ; Sony and <unk> have <unk> , * charging Warner with * attempting * to interfere in Sony 's acquisition of the two companies . 
<unk> 's net income in the latest quarter compared with a net loss of $ 6.9 million *U* , or 62 cents a share , in the year-earlier period . 
The company said 0 revenue rose <unk> % , to $ <unk> million *U* from $ 4.6 million *U* , * reflecting the success of its movies `` <unk> in the <unk> '' and `` <unk> , '' as well as the <unk> <unk> `` <unk> .

I show it to my friends , and they all say <unk> <unk> . '

Still , most consumers are n't <unk> <unk> film into their cameras * to take family <unk> . 
One big obstacle is that few <unk> develop the film anymore . 
Typically , it must be mailed * to a handful of processors and may take a week or more * to be processed and returned * . 
<unk> film costs consumers a little less than color film , and processing costs the same . 
But for <unk> , developing costs for <unk> film are higher .

`` Black and white has n't made the same <unk> <unk> in technological development as color , '' says *T* Mr. Butler of the Rochester Institute . 
`` The color print today is far superior to <unk> of 10 years ago . 
You <unk> n't say the same with black and white . ''

The price was n't disclosed * . 
A spokesman for <unk> said that the Swiss oil concern was examining the offer , submitted * last Friday , along with two other offers , also submitted * last week . 
Those two offers were private and the spokesman refused * to identify the bidding companies . 
The spokesman further said that at least two more offers <unk> are expected * from other companies within two weeks .

While Friday 's plunging stock market prompted new fears about the economy 's prospects , a <unk> indicator that *T* has <unk> <unk> the economy 's <unk> and <unk> by <unk> long lead times points to a sustained rise in overall business activity . 
The barometer , developed * by analysts at Columbia University 's Center for International Business <unk> Research here , reached a record high of <unk> in August , the latest month available , and the Columbia researchers estimate that it has moved even higher since then . 
The latest reading of <unk> was up from <unk> in July and <unk> as recently as March . 
The August rise marked the fifth straight monthly gain for the indicator , which *T* uses the 1967 average as a base of 100 . 
In contrast , the Commerce Department 's widely followed index of leading indicators , while up in August , has fallen repeatedly since * reaching a high early this year . 
Its <unk> behavior through much of 1989 has prompted some forecasters to anticipate the start of a new recession perhaps before year 's end . 
But the far stronger showing of the Columbia index `` makes a recession any time soon highly unlikely , '' says 0 *T* Geoffrey H. Moore , the director of the Columbia facility . 
* A leading authority on the business cycle , Mr. Moore also is a member of the Business <unk> <unk> Group , the panel of private economists that *T* decides for the government when <unk> and <unk> begin and end *T* . 
The group normally <unk> only when a change in the economy 's general course seems likely *T* . 
`` No meeting is scheduled * because the expansion shows no sign of * going off the tracks , '' Mr. Moore reports *T* . 
* Based * largely on the recent strength in their index , called * the long leading indicator , the Columbia analysts <unk> <unk> economic growth through the rest of this year and next year as well . 
They expect a 2.6 % rise in 1990 in the gross national product , after adjustment for inflation . 
<unk> this optimism is *T* the index 's longstanding ability * to signal <unk> or <unk> , as the case may be *?* , by substantially greater periods than the Commerce Department 's index of leading indicators . 
Over the full <unk> War II era , the Columbia index , on the average , has entered sustained declines 14 months before the <unk> of <unk> and turned up eight months before <unk> . 
The comparable lead times for the Commerce index , whose components *T* include the stock market , are far shorter -- 10 months before <unk> and only three months before <unk> . 
The Columbia economists also have <unk> how the long leading index would have <unk> *T* , had it existed , in 1929 , before the stock market crash in October that *T* <unk> in the Great Depression . 
The indicator reached a peak in January 1929 and then fell steadily up to <unk> and through <unk> the crash . 
`` It was an entirely different pattern from what we 're seeing *T* now , '' Mr. Moore says *T* . 
A major source of the recent strength in the long leading indicator has been the performance of the Dow Jones corporate <unk> index , which *T* is not a part of the Commerce index . 
In August , the bond measure was at its highest monthly average since early 1987 . 
It also rose last Friday , while the stock market <unk> . 
Other components of the long leading indicator include a ratio of prices to unit labor costs in manufacturing industries , the <unk> version of the money supply , adjusted * for inflation , and the volume of new <unk> permits . 
<unk> absent from the Columbia index is *T* the stock market , which Mr. Moore says 0 `` *T* is simply no longer such a good indicator of the economy 's long-range prospects , though it still is useful for * <unk> some <unk> <unk> and turns . '' 
As recently as 1975 , the stock market -- as * reflected * in the Standard & Poor 's index of 500 common stocks -- was rated * by the National Bureau of Economic Research as the best of the 12 leading indicators that *T* then made up the Commerce index . 
It was assigned * a mark of 80 out of a possible 100 , compared with scores ranging as low as 69 for the other components . 
The stock market has lost some <unk> power , analysts at the Columbia center claim 0 *T* , because of the growing impact of international developments . 
`` Stocks have become more sensitive to factors not directly tied * to the domestic economy , '' Mr. Moore says *T* , * citing the exchange rate for the dollar on currency markets , the <unk> balance and <unk> of foreign capital . 
He also feels that the rise of such <unk> practices as program trading has diminished the stock market 's <unk> to the economic outlook .

Commodity futures prices generally reflected the stability of the stock market following its plunge Friday . 
Yesterday , the stock market 's influence at first created nervousness . 
Later , however , it became more of an <unk> than a <unk> force as individual markets reacted more to their own factors . 
Gold , the traditional <unk> in times of financial crisis , continued its <unk> <unk> with the dollar , * rising early in the day as the currency fell , and then giving up some of its gains as the dollar recovered . 
Copper and crude oil reacted sharply to the concern that a crash yesterday could have a potentially devastating effect on the economy . 
Copper fell and showed little rebound through the day as one of the major supply problems that *T* had been supporting prices appeared * to be solved * . 
<unk> oil declined early , but as the stock market retained early gains , it , too , became stronger , * ending with a small net loss . 
Trading in cotton and sugar was nervous and showed small declines . 
In Chicago , grain and soybean prices rose slightly .

In commodity markets yesterday : <unk> <unk> : Futures prices were moderately higher as gold gave up some of its early gains and platinum <unk> independently , * first falling and then later rising . 
Silver performed quietly . 
The spot October gold price rose $ 4 *U* to $ <unk> *U* an ounce . 
The more active December delivery gold settled with a gain of $ <unk> *U* an ounce at $ <unk> *U* , after * trading as high as $ <unk> *U* . 
December silver was up 2.3 cents an ounce at $ <unk> *U* . 
<unk> <unk> more like an industrial metal , * easing early on concern over a possible weaker economy , but recovering later , as the stock market strengthened . 
Gold was nowhere the spectacular <unk> 0 it was *T* two years ago on Black Monday . 
For one thing , last Friday , precious metals markets closed before the stock market went into its <unk> nose <unk> , so it could n't react to it . 
Back on Friday , Oct. 16 , <unk> , the stock market declined during the day , and gold prices surged as the stock market fell . 
The October 1987 contract that day rose as much as $ <unk> *U* to as high as $ <unk> *U* , and the more deferred positions , due * to mature as late as March 1989 , rose as much as $ <unk> *U* . 
On Black Monday , Oct. 19 , 1987 , the October contract <unk> on further gains , * rising to as high as $ <unk> *U* for a gain of almost $ 20 *U* on top of the Friday advances , before * giving up almost $ 10 *U* of that at the close . 
Yesterday 's October gain of $ 4 *U* was <unk> compared with that . 
One analyst , Peter <unk> of <unk> & Co. , New York , said 0 the gold market already had some good <unk> technical factors that *T* would have caused prices to rise , with or without the stock market . 
`` What the stock market did *T* was cause the rise to take place earlier than it would have happened *?* , '' said *T* Mr. <unk> . 
There 's a good chance that gold will retain its gains and rise further , he said 0 *T* . 
He expects a drop in interest rates , which *T* would help gold by * keeping the dollar from * rising . 
Finally , according to Mr. <unk> , the impact of the strong dollar should be reflected * in reduced exports in the August merchandise trade deficit , when the figures are released * today *T* . 
This would be damaging to the dollar and <unk> for gold , he said 0 *T* . 
<unk> : 
* <unk> that Friday 's <unk> stock market plunge might be a <unk> of things 0 *T* to come for the economy , petroleum futures traders called a halt to the recent string of increases in crude oil futures prices . 
The U.S. benchmark crude , West Texas Intermediate , closed at $ <unk> *U* a barrel for November delivery , down 30 cents . 
Some analysts said 0 crude was due for a correction <unk> , following several days of significant gains . 
But most market observers agreed that Friday 's stock market drop is what *T* <unk> spirits in the petroleum pits yesterday . 
Until yesterday , futures prices had been headed * up on expectations that world oil demand will continue * to be strong . 
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries increased its production ceiling for the fourth quarter based on projections of robust demand . 
So any bearish indicator , such as Friday 's <unk> drop in the stock market , sends <unk> through the oil markets as well . 
Indeed , after * <unk> early in the trading day to Friday 's <unk> , futures prices firmed up again as traders took note of the stock market 's partial recovery yesterday . 
<unk> : 
Futures prices fell and showed little rebound as one major labor problem that *T* had been <unk> prices appeared * to be solved * . 
The December contract declined <unk> cents a pound to $ <unk> *U* . 
Prices were down from the <unk> of trading on concern that a drop in the stock market might create a weakened economy and a <unk> reduction in copper use . 
But the recovery in the stock market provided little help for copper as word <unk> spread that a three-month strike at the <unk> Valley mine in British Columbia was about over , according to an analyst . 
<unk> Valley is a large Canadian producer and principal supplier to Japan , which *T* recently began * seeking copper elsewhere as its inventories shrank . 
Last week it was reported that company and union negotiations had overcome the major hurdle , the contracting out of work by the company . 
Now , the analyst said 0 *T* , only minor points remain * to be <unk> * up . 
`` For all <unk> and purposes , an agreement appears * to have been achieved * , '' he said *T* . 
Copper inventories in New York 's Commodity Exchange warehouses rose yesterday by <unk> tons , to <unk> tons . 
London Metal Exchange copper inventories last week declined <unk> tons , to <unk> tons . 
The <unk> stocks decline was about as * expected * , but the Comex gain was n't *?* . 
However , this was <unk> * aside by concern over the stock market , the analyst said 0 *T* . 
At one point in futures trading , as the stock market firmed , the December contract rose to as high as $ <unk> *U* , but it was n't able * to sustain the gain . 
`` It was simply <unk> , '' he said 0 *T* , and selling by funds that *T* are computer <unk> helped * depress prices . 
<unk> : 
Futures prices eased , more in reaction to <unk> Jerry than to any influence of the stock market . 
The December contract ended with a loss of <unk> cent a pound , at <unk> cents . 
Technical considerations following the <unk> , which *T* was a factor in the market Friday , caused prices to decline yesterday , said 0 *T* Ernest Simon , cotton specialist for Prudential-Bache Securities , New York . 
Prices rose sharply Friday as the storm approached Texas and Louisiana , which *T* is part of the Mississippi Delta <unk> area . 
However , after * <unk> the potential effect of the <unk> , prices began * to slip late Friday , Mr. Simon said 0 *T* . 
That selling continued yesterday and kept prices under pressure , he said 0 *T* . 
<unk> weather <unk> is being predicted * for the high <unk> of Texas and the northern states of the Delta during the coming weekend , Mr. Simon said 0 *T* . 
That has n't yet captured traders ' attention , he added 0 *T* . 
<unk> : 
Futures prices declined . 
The March contract was off <unk> cent a pound at <unk> cents . 
At one point in early trading the March price rose to as high as <unk> cents when the stock market recovered *T* , but the price then fell back . 
A <unk> factor , one analyst said 0 *T* , was that India , which *T* had been expected * to buy around 200,000 tons of sugar in the world market , did n't make any purchases . 
India recently bought 200,000 tons and was expected * to buy more , the analyst said 0 *T* . 
Another analyst thought that India may have pulled back because of the concern over the stock market . 
`` India may have felt that if there was a severe drop in the stock market and it affected sugar , it could buy at lower prices , '' said *T* <unk> <unk> , analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton , New York .

The name change and good will write-off could help * <unk> Blue Arrow 's dominance of the U.S. <unk> market and give it a more American image as U.S. investors turn <unk> about foreign stocks after Friday 's market plunge . 
U.S. holders now own more than 60 % of Blue Arrow compared with 9 % last January . 
`` In the U.S. market , the recognition of the <unk> name is <unk> stronger than Blue Arrow , '' Mr. <unk> said *T* . 
The moves also could <unk> shareholders ' perception of Blue Arrow as a company in turmoil . 
`` It further <unk> the concept that Blue Arrow is a thing of the past , '' said *T* <unk> Arthur , an analyst at Kidder Peabody & Co. in New York . 
The proposed changes `` all make a lot of sense to me , '' he added 0 *T* . 
In a widely publicized <unk> coup , Mr. <unk> ousted <unk> <unk> as Blue Arrow chief executive in January , a month after Mr. <unk> had forced Mr. <unk> out as the $ 1 <unk> *U* chief of <unk> <unk> . 
Mr. <unk> <unk> his control in April by * taking over from Mr. <unk> as chairman . 
But the Blue Arrow <unk> is n't over yet , as the British government is investigating a disputed # 25 million *U* -LRB- $ <unk> million *U* -RRB- loan which Mr. <unk> has said 0 *T* was made * under Mr. <unk> 's direction . 
Blue Arrow was able * to pull off the $ <unk> billion *U* takeover of <unk> in 1987 largely because different British and American accounting standards produce higher reported earnings for British companies . 
Under British rules , Blue Arrow was able * to write off at once the $ 1.15 billion *U* in good will arising from the purchase . 
* As a <unk> company , Blue Arrow would have * to <unk> the good will over as many as 40 years , * creating a continuing drag on reported earnings . 
Good will is the excess of cost of an acquired firm , operating unit or assets over the current or fair market value of those assets . 
But with so many shares now held * in the U.S. , Blue Arrow reports its earnings two ways , based on both U.K. and U.S. accounting standards . 
`` Our balance sheets look like they came from <unk> 's <unk> , '' Mr. <unk> said *T* . 
The British version shows `` a handful of pounds of net worth '' following the 1987 write-off of good will , while the American version reflects `` $ 1 billion *U* of net worth because almost none of -LCB- the good will -RCB- has been written * off . '' 
Mr. <unk> said 0 he hopes * to <unk> some of the good will left * on Blue Arrow 's U.S. books in one fell <unk> , but would n't specify how much . 
People close to Blue Arrow suggested 0 the write-down would represent a sizable chunk , with executives claiming 0 prior management <unk> the extent of <unk> 's good will . 
That move , along with the return to the <unk> name , could bolster the company 's prospects during possibly difficult times for temporary help . 
The number of U.S. temporary workers fell about 1 % in the 12 months ending Aug. 31 , after * <unk> nearly 3.5 % in July , said 0 *T* Kidder Peabody 's Mr. Arthur . 
Blue Arrow blamed the pretax profit drop in the quarter ended July 31 partly on slower earnings growth of <unk> units in Britain . 
Overall , pretax profit slid to # <unk> million *U* in the quarter from # <unk> million *U* a year earlier . 
Richard G. <unk> , the man credited * with * <unk> <unk> Power Inc. from an <unk> into a <unk> player in the global market for <unk> tools , hopes * to guide a similar turnaround at the company 's latest acquisition , Barry Wright <unk> . 
The <unk> former General Electric Co. executive figures 0 it will be easier this time . 
But analysts , while * <unk> the acquisition , say 0 <unk> 's chief executive faces a tough challenge in * <unk> the two companies . 
Barry Wright , acquired * by <unk> for $ <unk> million *U* , makes <unk> equipment and <unk> systems . 
The <unk> , Mass. , company 's sales have been <unk> and its profits have dropped . 
Last year 's earnings of $ 1.3 million *U* , including $ <unk> *U* from a restructuring gain , were far below the year-earlier $ 8.4 million *U* . 
Besides * <unk> Barry Wright 's sales , which *T* were $ <unk> million *U* in 1988 , Mr. <unk> must <unk> its costs and product line . 
`` The question is how long it 's going * to take Barry Wright *T* * to make a contribution , '' says *T* F. John <unk> , an analyst at <unk> Ellis <unk> in Milwaukee . 
The answer will help * determine whether <unk> continues * to reach the ambitious goals set * by Mr. <unk> . 
The Butler , Wis. , manufacturer went public at $ <unk> *U* a share in August 1987 , and Mr. <unk> 's goal then was a $ 29 per-share *U* price by 1992 . 
Strong earnings growth helped * achieve that price far ahead of schedule , in August 1988 . 
The stock has since <unk> , * trading around $ 25 *U* a share last week and closing yesterday at $ <unk> *U* in national over-the-counter trading . 
But Mr. <unk> has set a fresh target of $ 50 *U* a share by the end of 
* <unk> that goal , says 0 *T* Robert T. <unk> , <unk> 's chief financial officer , will require `` efficient <unk> '' of cash by <unk> and continuation of its healthy 19 % rate of return on operating capital . 
In Barry Wright , Mr. <unk> sees a situation `` very similar '' to the one 0 he faced *T* when he joined <unk> as president and chief operating officer in 1985 *T* . 
<unk> , then a closely held company , was <unk> under the management of its controlling family . 
While profitable , it `` was n't growing and was n't providing a satisfactory return on invested capital , '' he says 0 *T* . 
Mr. <unk> is confident that the drive * to dominate certain niche markets will work at Barry Wright as it has *?* at <unk> . 
He also <unk> an `` <unk> '' <unk> 0 *T* to develop a corporate culture that *T* rewards managers who *T* produce and where decision-making is shared * *T* . 
Mr. <unk> considers the new unit 's operations `` fundamentally sound '' and adds that Barry Wright has been fairly successful in * moving into markets that *T* have n't interested larger competitors . 
`` With a little <unk> , these businesses will perform very <unk> , '' Mr. <unk> says *T* . 
Within about six months , `` things will be moving in the right direction , '' he predicts 0 *T* . 
Mr. <unk> figures 0 it will be easier * to turn Barry Wright around since he 's now in the driver 's seat . 
When he came to <unk> *T* , `` I did n't have the power * to <unk> as I do today , '' he says 0 *T* . 
He was named * chief executive officer of <unk> in 1986 and became chairman last November . 
At <unk> , Mr. <unk> set growth as his first objective . 
He took the company public in an offering that *T* <unk> <unk> about $ <unk> million *U* , which *T* helped * launch the company 's acquisition program . 
Sales climbed to an estimated $ <unk> million *U* in fiscal 1989 , ended Aug. 31 , from $ <unk> million *U* in fiscal 1985 . 
The company expects that earnings , which *T* have <unk> steadily upward in recent years , reached about $ <unk> million *U* , or $ <unk> *U* a share , in the fiscal year just ended , up from $ <unk> million *U* in fiscal 1988 and $ 3.9 million *U* in 1985 .
